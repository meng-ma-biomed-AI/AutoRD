{"id": "Pityriasis-Rosea", "text": "Pityriasis rosea is a relatively mild skin disorder characterized by a salmon or pink colored, scaly rash. Pityriasis rosea most often affects children and young adults. In many individuals with pityriasis rosea, the characteristic rash develops after vague, nonspecific symptoms that resemble those associated with an upper respiratory infection. The rash is usually located on the back, chest and stomach and resolves on its own within one to three months. Certain treatments may reduce the duration of the rash. Researchers believe that pityriasis rosea is caused by an infectious pathogen, but they have been unable to isolate and identify such a pathogen. Some reports in the medical literature state that pityriasis rosea affects females more often than males; others state that the disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder most commonly affects individuals between the ages of 10 and 35, but has been reported in all age groups including infants and the elderly. Pityriasis rosea occurs with greater frequency in the spring and autumn months. A diagnosis of pityriasis rosea is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. In the earlier stages of the disorder, additional tests such as blood tests or a biopsy may be necessary to distinguish pityriasis rosea from similar skin disorders.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["Pityriasis rosea", [0, 15]], ["mild skin disorder", [33, 50]], ["Pityriasis rosea", [107, 122]], ["pityriasis rosea", [195, 210]], ["pityriasis rosea", [540, 555]], ["pityriasis rosea", [711, 726]], ["Pityriasis rosea", [995, 1010]], ["pityriasis rosea", [1090, 1105]], ["pityriasis rosea", [1353, 1368]], ["skin disorders", [1383, 1396]]], "rare_disease": [], "symptom_and_sign": [["salmon or pink colored, scaly rash", [71, 104]], ["rash", [232, 235]], ["resemble those associated with an upper respiratory infection", [285, 345]], ["rash", [352, 355]], ["rash", [509, 512]]], "anaphor": [["the disorder", [785, 796]], ["The disorder", [842, 853]], ["the disorder", [1258, 1269]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Pityriasis rosea", [0, 15]], ["salmon or pink colored, scaly rash", [71, 104]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [195, 210]], ["rash", [232, 235]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [195, 210]], ["resemble those associated with an upper respiratory infection", [285, 345]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [195, 210]], ["rash", [352, 355]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [195, 210]], ["rash", [509, 512]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Pityriasis rosea", [0, 15]], ["mild skin disorder", [33, 50]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [1353, 1368]], ["skin disorders", [1383, 1396]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["pityriasis rosea", [711, 726]], ["the disorder", [785, 796]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [711, 726]], ["The disorder", [842, 853]]], [["pityriasis rosea", [1353, 1368]], ["the disorder", [1258, 1269]]]]}}}

{"id": "Gorlin", "text": "Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (sutures) between certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis), unusually small eyes (microphthalmia), absence of some teeth (hypodontia), and/or excessive amounts of hair (hypertrichosis) on most areas of the body. Affected individuals may also exhibit a mild delay in physical development (growth retardation); short fingers and/or toes; and/or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the two long folds of skin on either side of the vaginal opening (labia majora) in females. In addition, there may be an abnormal opening between the two large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart (pulmonary artery and aorta), causing inappropriate recirculation of some blood through the lungs, rather than throughout the rest of the body (patent ductus arteriosus). In some cases, mild mental retardation may also be present. It is believed that Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Approximately four cases have been reported in the medical literature. Although all reported cases have involved females, the true ratio of affected females to males is not known. The first case of Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome was reported in the medical literature in 1960. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be diagnosed at birth, based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. The presence of patent ductus arteriosus occurring in association with Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be determined by a variety of tests. When an abnormal heart murmur is detected, chest X-rays may be ordered along with an electrocardiogram (ECG), a test that measures the heart muscle's electrical activity. Structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and its blood vessels can be analyzed through the reflection of sound waves (echocardiogram).

{"id": "Noonan-Syndrome", "text": "Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is typically evident at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and physical features that vary greatly in range and severity. In many affected individuals, associated abnormalities include a distinctive facial appearance; a broad or webbed neck; a low posterior hairline; a typical chest deformity and short stature. Characteristic features of the head and facial (craniofacial) area may include widely set eyes (ocular hypertelorism); skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis); a small jaw (micrognathia); a depressed nasal root; a short nose with broad base; and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears (pinnae). Distinctive skeletal malformations are also typically present, such as abnormalities of the breastbone (sternum), curvature of the spine (kyphosis and/or scoliosis), and outward deviation of the elbows (cubitus valgus). Many infants with Noonan syndrome also have heart (cardiac) defects, such as obstruction of proper blood flow from the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valvular stenosis) and thickening of the ventricular heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Additional abnormalities may include malformations of certain blood and lymph vessels, blood clotting and platelet deficiencies, learning difficulties or mild intellectual disability, failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism) by the first year of life in affected males, and/or other symptoms and findings. Noonan syndrome appears to affect more males than females and is thought to affect approximately one in 1,000 to one in 2,500 people. However, other reports indicate that the disorder may affect more than one in 1,000 newborns in the general population. Since Noonan syndrome was originally reported in 1883 (O. Kobylinski) and more thoroughly described in 1963 (J.A. Noonan and D.A. Ehmke), more than 500 patients shave been discussed in the medical literature.

{"id": "Dysplasia-Epiphysealis-Hemimelica", "text": "Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), also known as Trevor\u2019s disease, is a developmental bone disease of childhood. It is rare and clinical experience with this condition is limited. Most cases are diagnosed before 8 years of age. It is characterized by an abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, particularly of the lower limbs. The bones of the knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected, as well as part of the foot (tarsal bones). The upper limbs and spine are rarely involved. The abnormal cartilage produces an irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone (hemimelic), usually medial. DEH may affect a single bone (localized form), multiple bones in a single limb (classical form) or an entire limb (generalized) usually involving a leg from the pelvis to the foot. Approximately two-thirds of affected children have multiple lesions. DEH was first described in the medical literature in 1926. Trevor recognized this condition in 1950. The name, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica first appeared in the medical literature in 1956. The cause of DEH is unknown. There is no evidence that hereditary factors play a role in the development of this disease. More research is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause(s) of this disorder.

{"id": "Triploidy", "text": "Triploidy is a rare chromosomal abnormality. Triploidy is the presence of an additional set of chromosomes in the cell for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46 chromosomes per cell. The extra set of chromosomes originates either from the father or the mother during fertilization. Infants with triploidy usually are miscarried early in the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the infant dies within the first days of life. A few affected individuals have been reported to have survived to adulthood, but suffered from developmental delay, learning difficulties, seizures, hearing loss and other abnormalities. Those that survive have mosaic triploidy, meaning that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other cells have 69 chromosomes per cell.  Infants affected with complete triploidy suffer from growth restriction and multiple birth defects. Triploidy is the presence of a complete additional set of chromosomes. The triplication of the chromosomes is caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperms, or the fertilization of an egg by a sperm that has an extra set of chromosomes or by the fertilization of an egg that has an extra set of chromosomes by a normal sperm. This disorder does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. Triploidy accounts for 1-3 percent of all pregnancies. The condition occurs slightly more often in males than females; it is estimated that 2/3 of triploid pregnancies are male. The presence of multiple major malformations, low amniotic fluid and/or growth restriction on fetal ultrasound during pregnancy raises the suspicion of triploidy. The diagnosis can be made during pregnancy by chromosome analysis (karyotyping) of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The diagnosis can be confirmed after birth by chromosome analysis of tissue (skin) obtained from the affected infant. Triploidy cannot be diagnosed by chromosome microarray testing. The accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in the diagnosis of triploidy is still being studied. Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol and pregnancy-assisted plasma protein-A have been associated with an increased risk for triploidy.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["chromosomal abnormality", [20, 42]]], "rare_disease": [["Triploidy", [0, 8]], ["Triploidy", [45, 53]], ["triploidy", [309, 317]], ["triploidy", [667, 675]], ["triploidy", [821, 829]], ["Triploidy", [890, 898]], ["Triploidy", [1314, 1322]], ["triploidy", [1644, 1652]], ["Triploidy", [1924, 1932]], ["triploidy", [2086, 2094]], ["triploidy", [2325, 2333]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["developmental delay", [544, 562]], ["learning difficulties", [565, 585]], ["seizures", [588, 595]], ["hearing loss", [598, 609]], ["growth restriction", [843, 860]], ["multiple birth defects", [866, 887]], ["multiple major malformations", [1508, 1535]], ["low amniotic fluid", [1538, 1555]], ["growth restriction on fetal", [1564, 1590]], ["Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins", [2120, 2170]]], "anaphor": [["This disorder", [1222, 1234]], ["The condition", [1369, 1381]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["triploidy", [309, 317]], ["developmental delay", [544, 562]]], [["triploidy", [309, 317]], ["learning difficulties", [565, 585]]], [["triploidy", [309, 317]], ["seizures", [588, 595]]], [["triploidy", [309, 317]], ["hearing loss", [598, 609]]], [["triploidy", [821, 829]], ["growth restriction", [843, 860]]], [["triploidy", [821, 829]], ["multiple birth defects", [866, 887]]], [["triploidy", [1644, 1652]], ["multiple major malformations", [1508, 1535]]], [["triploidy", [1644, 1652]], ["low amniotic fluid", [1538, 1555]]], [["triploidy", [1644, 1652]], ["growth restriction on fetal", [1564, 1590]]], [["triploidy", [2325, 2333]], ["Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins", [2120, 2170]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Triploidy", [0, 8]], ["chromosomal abnormality", [20, 42]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Triploidy", [890, 898]], ["This disorder", [1222, 1234]]], [["Triploidy", [1314, 1322]], ["The condition", [1369, 1381]]]]}}}
{"id": "Eosinophilic-Gastroenteritis", "text": "Eosinophilic gastroenteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. Symptoms include dysphagia (sometimes presenting as food impaction), heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating (ascites is possible). The eosinophilic infiltration may involve one or more layers of the gastrointestinal wall. The particular symptoms present in each person depend upon the layer and the location of involvement. Most commonly, the stomach wall and the small bowel are involved. Mucosal involvement leads to protein-losing enteropathy and malabsorption. Muscle layer involvement causes abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspeptic symptoms and bowel obstruction. Subserosal involvement predominantly causes ascites with marked eosinophilia. Sometimes eosinophilic pleural effusion is present. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a chronic, waxing and waning condition. The exact cause of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is unknown. Some cases of this disease may be caused by a hypersensitivity to certain foods or other unknown allergens. Often, a family history of allergy is present. Atopy (asthma, hay fever or eczema) is present in a subset of patients. Food allergies are common. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease (10/100.000) that affects both males and females, but is slightly more common among men. Peak prevalence is in children and adults 20-50 years of age. The reported prevalence has increased markedly, and this is probably due to prior under-diagnosis. People with a history of allergies, eczema, and seasonal asthma are more likely to develop this disease. Some patients present with elevated IgE and eosinophilia of tissue and blood.

{"id": "Median-Arcuate-Ligament-Syndrome", "text": "The median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a cause of chronic abdominal pain affecting both children and adults alike. Chronic abdominal pain is a very common condition that can have significant negative, long-term psychosocial consequences, including increased risk for anxiety, school and work absences, poor functional capacity, and a poor quality of life. While the exact cause of the pain is unknown, compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm can result in pain that is worsened with eating or sometimes with exercise. Other symptoms include nausea and weight loss. In some patients the symptoms can be devastating and can lead to erroneous diagnoses of an eating disorder, psychiatric conditions, or functional abdominal pain (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal migraine). The diagnosis is made based on a combination of the clinical symptoms and radiology imaging. There is a surgical procedure that can be performed that is effective in approximately 60-80% of patients. Compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament is a poorly understood vascular compression syndrome involving the celiac artery and celiac nerve plexus that results in upper abdominal pain (frequently made worse with eating), weight loss, nausea and vomiting. Sometimes a doctor may hear a soft whooshing sound with a stethoscope (bruit) over the upper abdomen that may mean there is a vascular blockage. Some patients who are athletes may experience recurrent upper abdominal pain that is brought on by moderate to intense cardiovascular work outs. Additional symptoms associated with the diagnosis, but frequently indicative of other medical problems include palpitations (hearing or feeling your own heartbeat), chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, and difficulty sleeping. The characteristic MALS patient is more likely to be young adult female, which is consistent with demographic characteristics of other chronic abdominal pain (CAP) patients. However, given the wide distribution of celiac artery compression, the syndrome affects both young and old as well as women and men.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["eating disorder", [706, 720]], ["psychiatric conditions", [723, 744]], ["irritable bowel syndrome", [782, 805]], ["abdominal migraine", [808, 825]], ["vascular compression syndrome", [1116, 1144]]], "rare_disease": [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["MALS", [38, 41]], ["MALS", [1841, 1844]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["chronic abdominal pain", [58, 79]], ["Chronic abdominal pain", [123, 144]], ["anxiety", [275, 281]], ["school and work absences", [284, 307]], ["poor functional capacity", [310, 333]], ["poor quality of life", [342, 361]], ["pain", [393, 396]], ["compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm", [410, 490]], ["compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm", [410, 490]], ["pain", [506, 509]], ["nausea", [591, 596]], ["weight loss", [602, 612]], ["functional abdominal pain", [750, 774]], ["abdominal pain", [1220, 1233]], ["weight loss", [1272, 1282]], ["nausea", [1285, 1290]], ["vomiting", [1296, 1303]], ["soft whooshing sound with a stethoscope (bruit) over the upper abdomen", [1336, 1405]], ["vascular blockage", [1432, 1448]], ["recurrent upper abdominal pain", [1497, 1526]], ["palpitations", [1707, 1718]], ["chest pain", [1761, 1770]], ["diarrhea", [1773, 1780]], ["constipation", [1783, 1794]], ["difficulty sleeping", [1801, 1819]], ["chronic abdominal pain", [1957, 1978]]], "anaphor": [["the syndrome", [2063, 2074]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["chronic abdominal pain", [58, 79]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["Chronic abdominal pain", [123, 144]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["anxiety", [275, 281]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["school and work absences", [284, 307]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["poor functional capacity", [310, 333]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["poor quality of life", [342, 361]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["pain", [393, 396]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm", [410, 490]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm", [410, 490]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["pain", [506, 509]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["nausea", [591, 596]]], [["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]], ["weight loss", [602, 612]]], [["irritable bowel syndrome", [782, 805]], ["functional abdominal pain", [750, 774]]], [["abdominal migraine", [808, 825]], ["functional abdominal pain", [750, 774]]], [["vascular compression syndrome", [1116, 1144]], ["abdominal pain", [1220, 1233]]], [["vascular compression syndrome", [1116, 1144]], ["weight loss", [1272, 1282]]], [["vascular compression syndrome", [1116, 1144]], ["nausea", [1285, 1290]]], [["vascular compression syndrome", [1116, 1144]], ["vomiting", [1296, 1303]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["soft whooshing sound with a stethoscope (bruit) over the upper abdomen", [1336, 1405]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["vascular blockage", [1432, 1448]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["recurrent upper abdominal pain", [1497, 1526]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["palpitations", [1707, 1718]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["chest pain", [1761, 1770]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["diarrhea", [1773, 1780]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["constipation", [1783, 1794]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["difficulty sleeping", [1801, 1819]]], [["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["chronic abdominal pain", [1957, 1978]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [[["MALS", [38, 41]], ["median arcuate ligament syndrome", [4, 35]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["MALS", [1841, 1844]], ["the syndrome", [2063, 2074]]]]}}}

{"id": "Hutchinson", "text": "Progeria, or Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), is a rare, fatal, genetic condition of childhood with striking features resembling premature aging. Children with progeria usually have a normal appearance in early infancy. At approximately nine to 24 months of age, affected children begin to experience profound growth delays, resulting in short stature and low weight. They also develop a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a disproportionately small face in comparison to the head; an underdeveloped jaw (micrognathia); malformation and crowding of the teeth; abnormally prominent eyes; a small nose; prominent eyes and a subtle blueness around the mouth. In addition, by the second year of life, the scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are lost (alopecia), and the scalp hair may be replaced by small, downy, white or blond hairs. Additional characteristic features include generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, hip dislocations, unusually prominent veins of the scalp, loss of the layer of fat beneath the skin (subcutaneous adipose tissue), defects of the nails, joint stiffness, skeletal defects, and/or other abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, individuals with HGPS develop premature, widespread thickening and loss of elasticity of artery walls (arteriosclerosis), which result in life-threatening complications during childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Children with progeria die of heart disease (atherosclerosis) at an average age of 13 years, with a range of about eight to 21 years. As with any person suffering from heart disease, the common events as heart disease advances for children with progeria can include high blood pressure, strokes, angina (chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart itself), enlarged heart, and heart failure, all conditions associated with aging. HGPS is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females equally, and all races equally. The disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1886 (J. Hutchinson) and 1897 (H.

It occurs mainly in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, India, South Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Transients, tourists and visitors to these areas can be affected. Treatment for Tropical Sprue includes the use of folic acid, cobalamin, and antibiotics such as tetracycline, oxytetracycline, or ampicillin. The dosage of these medications depends on the severity of the disorder as well as how the patient responds to the therapy. Combined therapy with folic acid and tetracycline seems to rapidly reduce the severity of the symptoms and also heal unhealthy tissue in the small intestine.

It is the most common form of focal dystonia in an office setting. Cervical dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the neck that cause abnormal movements and postures of the neck and head. In some cases, these abnormal contractions may be sustained or continuous; in others, they may be present as spasms that can resemble tremor. The severity of cervical dystonia can vary, but the disorder can cause significant pain and discomfort as well as difficulty due to the abnormal postures. It can affect quality of life and activities of daily living including employment. Cervical dystonia typically begins in middle age, and rarely begins in adolescence and young adulthood. The cause of cervical dystonia is unknown, although a genetic susceptibility is thought to underlie some cases. If cervical dystonia begins in infancy or early childhood, secondary causes should be investigated. Cervical dystonia affects women approximately twice as often as men. It is the most common form of focal dystonia in an office setting. Cervical dystonia may affect individuals of any age, but typically develops in people between 40 and 60 years of age.

{"id": "Mitral-Valve-Prolapse-Syndrome", "text": "The mitral valve is the valve between the left upper and left lower chambers (left atrium and left ventricle) of the heart. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) is a common condition in which one or both of the flaps (cusps) of the mitral valve bulge or collapse backward (prolapse) into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole). In some cases, this may allow leakage or the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium (mitral regurgitation).

{"id": "AIDS-Dysmorphic-Syndrome", "text": "\"The term \"\"AIDS dysmorphic syndrome\"\" or \"\"HIV embryopathy\"\" has been used by some researchers to describe specific facial malformations (i.e., craniofacial dysmorphism), an unusually small head, and growth deficiency in some infants infected with HIV.* Such craniofacial abnormalities have included a prominent, boxlike forehead, large, wide eyes; a flattened nasal bridge, and an unusually pronounced philtrum, which is the vertical groove in the center of the upper lip. Most new cases of HIV infection in young children (pediatric HIV infection) are caused by transmission from the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding (perinatal transmission).  Estimates suggest that the transmission rate from untreated HIV-positive mothers in the United States is approximately 12 to 30 percent. (For further information, please see the \u201cStandard Therapies\u201d section of this report below.)  Women with HIV infection are most often infected through heterosexual relations with an infected partner or injection drug use. Perinatal HIV infection is thought to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  As noted above, in some cases, certain dysmorphic features have been observed prior to the onset of symptoms associated with immunodeficiency.  However, the significance of such observations has been questioned (see \u201cSymptoms\u201d).  Symptoms and findings resulting from immunodeficiency may become apparent during the first or second year of life or later during childhood. Perinatal HIV infection is considered in infants of mothers known to be HIV-positive and/or in infants and children who have certain characteristic symptoms of HIV infection or immune system abnormalities. Infants who are born to mothers with HIV have antibodies against the virus in the bloodstream at birth (passively acquired maternal antibodies). In infants and children who are not infected with HIV, these passive antibodies eventually disappear, usually between six to 12 months, however, in some cases, they may be detectable for up to 18 months. Therefore, testing that detects the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood (serum antibody tests, e.g., enzyme immunoassay and confirmatory Western blot) in a child 18 months or older usually indicates infection; however, such testing is not conclusive in children younger than 18 months. In these children, HIV infection may be confirmed through the repeated use of various specialized viral detection laboratory tests (e.g., HIV viral cultures, a DNA-amplification and copying method known as polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). Additional laboratory tests may also be conducted to assess immune functioning in order to assist in diagnosis and to monitor disease progression and its treatment. Testing may include monitoring of helper T cell numbers (CD4+ cells), the ratio of helper T cells to certain other white blood cells (CD8+ cells), complete blood counts, and blood platelet levels.\"", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["HIV.", [249, 252]], ["HIV", [736, 738]], ["HIV", [918, 920]], ["HIV", [1571, 1573]], ["HIV", [1659, 1661]], ["immune system abnormalities", [1676, 1702]], ["HIV", [1742, 1744]], ["HIV", [1900, 1902]], ["HIV", [2363, 2365]], ["HIV", [2482, 2484]]], "rare_disease": [["AIDS dysmorphic syndrome", [12, 35]], ["HIV embryopathy", [44, 58]], ["HIV infection in young children", [493, 523]], ["pediatric HIV infection", [526, 548]], ["Perinatal HIV infection", [1035, 1057]], ["Perinatal HIV infection", [1499, 1521]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["facial malformations", [117, 136]], ["craniofacial dysmorphism", [145, 168]], ["small head", [185, 194]], ["growth deficiency in some infants infected with HIV", [201, 251]], ["craniofacial abnormalities", [260, 285]], ["rominent, boxlike forehead", [304, 329]], ["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["flattened nasal bridge", [352, 373]], ["pronounced philtrum", [393, 411]], ["immunodeficiency", [1253, 1268]], ["immunodeficiency", [1395, 1410]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["pediatric HIV infection", [526, 548]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["HIV", [736, 738]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["HIV", [918, 920]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["Perinatal HIV infection", [1035, 1057]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["immunodeficiency", [1395, 1410]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["flattened nasal bridge", [352, 373]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["pronounced philtrum", [393, 411]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["HIV", [1571, 1573]]], [["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]], ["HIV", [1659, 1661]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [[["HIV embryopathy", [44, 58]], ["large, wide eyes", [332, 347]]], [["pediatric HIV infection", [526, 548]], ["HIV infection in young children", [493, 523]]]], "anaphora": []}}}

Because of an overlap of these symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), many patients are initially thought to have GERD, but EoE patients do not typically respond to anti-GERD therapy and can be found not to have GERD upon diagnostic workup. Recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, typically used for the treatment of GERD, but these patients with PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) do not typically have GERD but rather a disease variant similar to EoE; the PPI appears to exert its effects by direct action rather than blockade of stomach acid alone. Individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis often have allergic diseases such as asthma or eczema. The frequency of eosinophilic esophagitis has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 1,000 children.

{"id": "Macroglossia", "text": "Macroglossia is the abnormal enlargement of the tongue. In rare cases, macroglossia occurs as an isolated finding that is present at birth (congenital). In many cases, macroglossia may occur secondary to a primary disorder that may be either congenital (e.g., Down syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) or acquired (e.g., as a result of trauma or malignancy). Symptoms and physical findings associated with macroglossia may include noisy, high-pitched breathing (stridor), snoring, and/or feeding difficulties. In some cases, the tongue may protrude from the mouth. When inherited, macroglossia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Macroglossia is a disorder characterized by a tongue that is large in proportion to other structures in the mouth.  In the congenital type of the disorder, protrusion of the tongue from the mouth may interfere with feeding of the infant.  Later, talking may be affected.  The large size of the tongue may also cause abnormal development of the jaw and teeth, resulting in misaligned or protruding teeth.  Ulceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue may be other symptoms of the disorder. Isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia is very rare, with about 50 cases reported in the medical literature.  The prevalence in other instances depends on the underlying disorder for which the macroglossia is secondary.  For example, macroglossia occurs in most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the prevalence of that syndrome is estimated at 1 in 17,000 births.

Approximately 10% of cases of HMO are thought to be the result of new mutations. At present two genes, EXT1 and EXT2, are known to show mutations in HMO patients and it is thought that these genes function as tumor suppressors.

Most likely, they have an EXT1 or EXT2 mutation in only part of their body cells and the mutation is absent or undetectable in blood cells, which are usually used for DNA analysis.  Data indicates that individuals with EXT1 mutations may have more severe effects than those with EXT2 mutations. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy. The risk is the same for males and females.

{"id": "Ewing-Sarcoma", "text": "Ewing sarcoma is a rare bone tumor that occurs most often in adolescents. It can also arise outside of the bone in soft tissue (extraosseous Ewing sarcoma). Ewing sarcoma is related to another type of tumor known as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Researchers have learned that these tumors are associated with the same chromosomal abnormality (balanced reciprocal translocation) and share many physiological characteristics. Consequently, these tumors are sometimes collectively classified as the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). This general term encompasses Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin\u2019s tumor (a tumor of the chest wall). Ewing sarcoma of bone accounts for approximately 70 percent of the tumors in this family. Generally, the term Ewing sarcoma is preferred because, despite the different names, it is one tumor, molecularly.

TRPS1 is characterized by thin, sparse scalp hair, unusual facial features, abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes, and multiple abnormalities of the \"growing ends\" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a rounded (bulbous) \"pear-shaped\" nose, an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), dental anomalies, and/or unusually large (prominent) ears. In most cases, the fingers and/or toes may be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and curved. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit short stature. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. In most cases, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I has autosomal dominant inheritance.

The diagnosis of TRPS1 may be suspected upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., rounded [bulbous] nose; thin, sparse hair; etc.).

{"id": "Hypochondroplasia", "text": "Hypochrondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by small stature and disproportionately short arms, legs, hands, and feet (short-limbed dwarfism). Short stature often is not recognized until early to mid childhood or, in some cases, as late as adulthood. In those with the disorder, bowing of the legs typically develops during early childhood but often improves spontaneously with age. Some affected individuals may also have an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), a relatively prominent forehead, and/or other physical abnormalities associated with the disorder. In addition, in about 10 percent of cases, mild mental retardation may be present. Hypochondroplasia appears to affect females and males in relatively equal numbers.  The features of the disorder were originally reported in 1913; hypochondroplasia was described as a distinct disease entity in 1924.  Over 100 cases have since been recorded in the medical literature, including isolated (sporadic) and familial cases.  Hypochondroplasia is thought to have an incidence of approximately one-twelfth that of achondroplasia.  (Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a particular disorder or condition during a specific period.)  The estimated frequency of achondroplasia has ranged from about one in 15,000 to one in 35,000 births.

Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA.

{"id": "Tangier-Disease", "text": "Tangier disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the blood. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is often referred to as the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d as it can facilitate the removal of cholesterol out of the walls of arteries, particularly the coronary (heart) arteries. Classic features of Tangier disease include fatty accumulations that present as enlarged and yellow- or orange-colored tonsils, or enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes. Tangier disease may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, moderate elevation in triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), nerve disturbances (neuropathy), and rarely an opaqueness in the covering of the eye (corneal clouding). This disorder was originally named after the location in which it was first discovered - Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Later, the disease was further characterized as more individuals were found to have the disease in other areas of the United States and around the globe. Symptoms of Tangier disease are variable and depend on which organs are involved and the severity of those manifestations. Tangier disease is most often characterized by enlarged orange- or yellow-colored tonsils. This discoloration is due to fatty deposits accumulating in the tonsils. Fatty deposits can also form in other organs causing enlargement of the throat, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Fat accumulations in nerves can cause disturbances and loss-of-sensation called peripheral neuropathy. Discoloration may also occur in the digestive system, particularly the rectum and large intestine. Cardiovascular disease has been reported in adults with Tangier disease. In rare cases, a clouding of the cornea of the eye can occur, but is generally mild and does not cause vision impairment. Tangier disease is a rare disorder with only approximately 100 cases diagnosed worldwide.

{"id": "Gottron-Syndrome", "text": "Gottron syndrome (GS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging (progeria), especially in the form of unusually fragile, thin skin on the hands and feet (distal extremities).  GS is described as a mild, nonprogressive, congenital form of skin atrophy due to the loss of the fatty tissue directly under the skin (subcutaneous atrophy). Other findings may include abnormally small hands and feet with unusually prominent veins on the chest; small stature; and/or abnormally small jaw (micrognathia). From infancy on, children with Gottron syndrome appear older than their actual age.  The skin is unusually thin, taut, and parchment-like on the hands and feet (distal extremities).  The hands and feet remain abnormally small into adulthood.  The veins on the chest are very visible and prominent due to diminished amounts of fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat).

{"id": "Congenital-Sucrase", "text": "Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficiency or absence of the enzymes sucrase and isomaltase. This enzyme complex (sucrase-isomaltase) assists in the breakdown of a certain sugars (i.e., sucrose) and certain products of starch digestion (dextrins). The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex is normally found within the tiny, finger-like projections (microvilli or brush border) lining the small intestine. When this enzyme complex is deficient, nutrients based on ingested sucrose and starch cannot be absorbed properly from the gut.\nSymptoms of this disorder become evident soon after sucrose or starches, as found in modified milk formulas with sucrose or polycose, are ingested by an affected infant. Breast-fed infants or those on lactose-only formula manifest no symptoms until such time as sucrose (found in fruit juices, solid foods, and/or some medications) is introduced into the diet. Symptoms are variable among affected individuals but usually include watery diarrhea, abdominal swelling (distension) and/or discomfort, among others. Intolerance to starch often disappears within the first few years of life and the symptoms of sucrose intolerance usually improve as the affected child ages. CSID is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. CSID is a metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is diagnosed in approximately 0.2 percent of North Americans. This disorder has a higher frequency among Greenland and Canadian Inuit populations, with a reported incidence of approximately 10 percent. In addition, researchers report a higher degree of homozygosity among these more frequently affected groups than among other groups.

{"id": "Twin", "text": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when women are pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. It is a rare disease of the placenta, the organ that joins the mother to her offspring and provides nourishment to the developing fetuses. During the development of identical twins, there are always blood vessels in the fetuses' shared placenta that connect their blood circulations (placental anastomoses). In most cases, the blood flows properly through these vessels. However, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the blood begins to flow unevenly, with one fetal twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and one receiving too little (donor). The recipient twin may experience heart failure due to continual strain on its heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system). The donor twin, on the other hand, may experience life-threatening anemia, insufficient nutrition and oxygen due to its inadequate supply of blood. Such an imbalance in blood flow (i.e., twin-twin transfusion) can occur at any time during the pregnancy, including during delivery. TTTS is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when a mother is pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. There have been a few reported cases in which TTTS also affected identical triplets. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome affects approximately 5 to 15 percent of identical twin pregnancies, meaning that approximately 6,000 babies may be affected each year.

{"id": "Dracunculosis", "text": "Dracunculosis is an infection caused by a parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm. Infected water fleas release the larvae of the worm into drinking water. Ingestion of contaminated water causes the larvae to migrate from the intestines via the abdominal cavity to the tissue under the skin. The larvae mature and release a toxic substance that makes the overlying skin ulcerate. After treatment, symptoms disappear and the worms can be safely removed from the skin. Dracunculosis is characterized by chronic skin ulcers.  Tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae of the parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, or Guinea worm.  A female worm ready to release larvae produces stinging elevated spots (papules), causing redness and itching of the skin.  These symptoms may be an allergic reaction to the parasite.  The spots form blisters and later rupture, developing into painful ulcers.  Multiple ulcers (usually on the legs) are common.  Without treatment, the worms are absorbed or protrude from the skin over a period of several weeks. The cause of dracunculosis is the consumption of water contaminated by the larvae of the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis, which live in an intermediate host in the water.  The larvae are released from the intermediate host while in the stomach, where they mate and grow.  This stage lasts for as long as a year.  The female apparently survives this process and may grow to three feet in length.  The symptoms and characteristic ulcers and infections occur when the female moves from the stomach or intestine to tissues under the skin. In 1986, there were approximately 3.2 million cases of dracunculosis worldwide.  However, due to the efforts of several national and international organizations in cooperation with local governments, the incidence of the disease has significantly decreased.  According to current estimates, there are now fewer than 100,000 cases of dracunculosis worldwide, with the remaining cases primarily occurring in Sudan and certain countries in West Africa, such as Nigeria and Niger. In individuals with dracunculosis, the condition is diagnosed based upon characteristic symptoms (e.g., fever, pain, and blistering and ulceration of the affected area) in association with the emergence of the adult worm through the individual's skin.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["infection", [20, 28]]], "rare_disease": [["Dracunculosis", [0, 12]], ["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["dracunculosis", [1102, 1114]], ["dracunculosis", [1685, 1697]], ["dracunculosis", [1963, 1975]], ["dracunculosis", [2127, 2139]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["chronic skin ulcers", [525, 543]], ["Tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae", [547, 603]], ["papules", [749, 755]], ["redness", [767, 773]], ["itching of the skin", [779, 797]], ["painful ulcers", [921, 934]], ["ulcers", [947, 952]], ["characteristic ulcers", [1508, 1528]], ["infections", [1534, 1543]], ["fever", [2211, 2215]], ["pain", [2218, 2221]], ["blistering", [2228, 2237]], ["ulceration", [2243, 2252]]], "anaphor": [["the disease", [1847, 1857]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["chronic skin ulcers", [525, 543]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["Tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae", [547, 603]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["papules", [749, 755]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["redness", [767, 773]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["itching of the skin", [779, 797]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["painful ulcers", [921, 934]]], [["Dracunculosis", [491, 503]], ["ulcers", [947, 952]]], [["dracunculosis", [1102, 1114]], ["characteristic ulcers", [1508, 1528]]], [["dracunculosis", [1102, 1114]], ["infections", [1534, 1543]]], [["dracunculosis", [2127, 2139]], ["fever", [2211, 2215]]], [["dracunculosis", [2127, 2139]], ["pain", [2218, 2221]]], [["dracunculosis", [2127, 2139]], ["blistering", [2228, 2237]]], [["dracunculosis", [2127, 2139]], ["ulceration", [2243, 2252]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Dracunculosis", [0, 12]], ["infection", [20, 28]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["dracunculosis", [1685, 1697]], ["the disease", [1847, 1857]]]]}}}
{"id": "Yellow-Fever", "text": "Yellow Fever is a viral infection that causes damage to the liver, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Major symptoms may include sudden onset of fever, yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and hemorrhage. It occurs predominately in South America, the Caribbean Islands and Africa. The disease is spread through bites of infected mosquitos. Incidence of the disease tends to increase in the summer as the mosquito population increases, and it occurs year round in tropical climates. Yellow Fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite by an infected mosquito. Initially, a mosquito acquires the disease by ingesting the blood of an infected host.  The mosquito then transmits the infection to its next bite victim. Yellow Fever affects males and females equally. People living in semitropical or tropical climates are at risk unless they are vaccinated against this infection. People in southern areas of the United States, living near marshes and swamps may be at risk during the summer months. However, most cases of Yellow Fever occur in Africa and South America. The treatment of Yellow Fever is symptomatic and supportive. Preventative measures consist of mosquito control and a vaccine that prevents development of the infection. Immunity from a vaccination usually develops after 10 days and lasts for more than 10 years. In some cases, side effects associated with vaccination may occur five to 10 days later.

It occurs in an estimated 15 to 25 percent of people who undergo surgical removal of the adrenal glands for Cushing disease. Symptoms associated with Nelson syndrome include intense skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation), headaches, vision impairment, and the cessation of menstrual periods in women. Symptoms of Nelson syndrome include intense skin pigmentation, headaches, visual field disturbances and the cessation of menstrual periods in females. Blood levels of the pituitary hormones adrenocorticotrope hormone (ACTH) and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) are abnormally high.  The pituitary gland gets abnormally large in Nelson syndrome, causing headaches and visceral symptoms. Nelson syndrome can be caused by surgical removal of the adrenal glands on both sides of the body (bilateral adrenalectomy).  Removal of the adrenal glands is a treatment for Cushing disease.  Cushing disease is the name given to a condition in which Cushing syndrome, an endocrine disorder, occurs because of the presence of benign (non-cancerous) tumors on the pituitary gland.  Following removal of these adrenal glands, some people will develop Nelson syndrome.  Growth of a pre-existing or a concealed (occult) tumor of the pituitary gland may also cause this disorder. Nelson syndrome affects approximately 15 to 25% of people who have undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.  It affects males and females in equal numbers.

These disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked congenital neutropenia. The WAS gene abnormality results in a deficiency in the WASP protein that leads to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  WAS-related disorders usually present in infancy and are characterized by bloody diarrhea, recurrent infections, scaling, itchy, skin rashes (eczema), and the appearance of small purple spots on the skin (petechia). The development of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and intracranial bleeding are possible early, life-threatening complications. Later potential complications include destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), arthritis, vasculitis and kidney and liver damage.  Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing lymphomas, especially after exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. WAS-related disorders are extremely variable, even in individuals in the same family. The estimated prevalence of WAS-related disorders is 3/1,000,000 males.  This condition has been described in many ethnic groups and in many countries. A WAS-related disorder is suspected based on clinical features and laboratory testing.  Testing shows a low platelet count and small platelet size, and sometimes shows abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins: low IgM, elevated IgA and IgE, decreased absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells and decreased function of natural killer cells.

{"id": "Pseudocholinesterase-Deficiency", "text": "Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that makes an affected person very sensitive to any of several anesthetic agents, especially those derived from the drug known as choline. When anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. Mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum.  If the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea).  Artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing.  If the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the United States.  Among Caucasian Americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. Apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep.  Infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant\u2019s sleep.  Apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing.  When there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea.

With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible.

In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.

The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.

In general, symptoms of all forms of Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis include breathing difficulty, wheezing, and dry coughs that appear to shake the entire body.  Chills, sweating, aching, discomfort and/or fatigue may accompany lung symptoms.  Most cases of this disorder are characterized by mild, short episodes that may be misdiagnosed.

Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may affect males and females in equal numbers, but usually affects individuals in occupations in which animal or vegetable dusts are inhaled by people allergic to the substances contained in such dusts. Treatment of extrinsic allergic alveolitis initially depends on identification of the cause of the allergic reaction. If possible, the patient should avoid exposure to the allergen. In an occupational setting, mild cases may be alleviated by improved ventilation or use of air filtering masks. In severe or prolonged cases, however, changing jobs may be the better option. If symptoms persist in spite of avoidance, corticosteroid drugs may be tried. In acute cases, steroids in combination with avoidance measures can often reduce the severity of symptoms.

{"id": "Adams-Oliver-Syndrome", "text": "Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by defects of the scalp and abnormalities of the fingers, toes, arms, and/or legs. The physical abnormalities associated with this disorder vary greatly among affected individuals. Some cases may be very mild while others may be severe. In infants with Adams-Oliver syndrome, scalp defects are present at birth (congenital) and may include one or multiple hairless scarred areas that may have abnormally wide (dilated) blood vessels directly under the affected skin. In severe cases, an underlying defect of the bones of the skull may also be present. In addition, infants with this disorder typically have malformations of the hands, arms, feet, and/or legs. These range from abnormally short (hypoplastic) fingers and toes to absent hands and/or lower legs. In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. Most cases of AOS appear to follow autosomal dominant inheritance but autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. Adams-Oliver syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. More than 125 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The major physical features of Adams-Oliver syndrome (i.e., scalp defects and limb abnormalities) are apparent at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome may be suspected at birth based upon the identification of characteristic scalp and skull defects occurring in association with malformations of the fingers, toes, hands, and/or feet. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as advanced imaging techniques.

Symptoms can begin during infancy and may include drowsiness, seizures that may be accompanied by involuntary jerking muscle movements of the arms, legs, or head (myoclonic seizures), and intellectual disability. The symptoms of carnosinemia include extreme drowsiness and seizures that can occur in children under the age of one year. Slow growth, low muscle tone, motor delays, and delayed intellectual development also occur in children with this disorder. Seizures may be accompanied by myoclonic seizures. By approximately 2 years of age, affected children show variable degrees of intellectual deficit leading to intellectual disabilities and developmental regression. Some affected children also have muscle weakness (congenital myopathy). Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that detects electrical activity in the brain, may be abnormal.  A few patients reported with this condition have few or no symptoms. Carnosinemia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 30 individuals with carnosinemia have been reported in the medical literature world-wide. The diagnosis of carnosinemia may be made by testing the levels of amino acids in blood and/or urine, which reveals abnormally high levels of carnosine and anserine in the serum and urine.

Common symptoms include severe pain in the upper right area (quadrant) of the abdomen, fever, chills, headaches, and a general feeling of poor health (malaise). Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a general term for infection of the upper genital tract in women. Infection is most often caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. A diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is made through the exclusion of other causes of upper right abdominal pain. A diagnosis may be confirmed with a variety of specialized tests including x-ray examination, diagnostic laparoscopy, and certain laboratory exams. X-ray examination may include ultrasound, chest or stomach radiographs, and computed tomography (CT) scanning. X-rays are used to rule out other possible conditions or reveal characteristic inflammation of the perihepatic region.

{"id": "Cat-Eye-Syndrome", "text": "Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare chromosomal disorder that may be evident at birth. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. However, in individuals with CES, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In a small number of people with CES, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  The name \u201ccat eye syndrome\u201d is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. This defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat\u2019s eye. There are, however, many other features associated with CES involving many organs and systems. These symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. Associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. CES may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. While some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. CES has been recognized for more than a century. More than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. Many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. However, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of CES in the population. Schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in Northeastern Switzerland.

Symptoms of Balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. Most people with Balantidiasis are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms.  Some individuals may become acutely ill with abnormally high temperatures, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.

In very severe cases, the ulcers may be deep enough to puncture the intestinal wall (perforation) resulting in acute inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdomen (peritonitis). Occasionally, the ulcer may diminish lung function. Balantidiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by the single celled (protozoan) parasite Balantidium coli.  This parasite may be passed directly to humans by contact with pig feces or indirectly by drinking contaminated water.

Craniofacial abnormalities may consist of characteristic facial features that cause the individual to appear to be whistling. These features include an extremely small puckered mouth (microstomia); a \"\"full\"\" forehead appearance, unusually prominent cheeks; and thin, pursed lips. Affected infants may also have an unusually flat middle portion of the face, a high roof of the mouth (palate), an unusually small jaw (micrognathia), an abnormally small tongue (microglossia), and/or a raised, scar-like mark in the shape of an \"\"H\"\" or a \"\"V\"\" extending from the lower lip to the chin. Affected infants often have abnormalities affecting the eyes including widely-spaced deep-set eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Malformations of the hands and feet are also characteristic of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Children with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome may also exhibit speech impairment; swallowing and eating difficulties; vomiting; failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and/or respiratory problems that may result in life-threatening complications. Freeman-Sheldon syndrome can be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. However, most cases occur randomly with no apparent cause (sporadically).

PBC leads to inflammation and scarring of the small bile ducts (the plumbing system of the liver which transports bile, the substance that helps digest fat). When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person\u2019s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years. However, the disorder has been diagnosed in females as young as 22 years of age and in females in their early 90s.

{"id": "Anemia-Hemolytic-Acquired-Autoimmune", "text": "The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are rare disorders characterized by the premature destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells at a rate faster than they can be replaced. Acquired hemolytic anemias are non-genetic in origin. Idiopathic acquired autoimmune diseases occur when the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (e.g., lymphocytes, antibodies) destroy its own healthy tissues for no known reason. Normally, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a life span of approximately 120 days before being removed by the spleen. The severity of this type of anemia is determined by the life span of the red blood cell and by the rate at which these cells are replaced by the bone marrow. When acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs from unknown causes, it affects twice as many women as men, specifically women under 50 years old. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects elderly persons, and warm antibody hemolytic anemia can affect anyone at any age.

{"id": "Autoimmune-Blistering-Diseases", "text": "Autoimmune blistering diseases are a group of disorders in which the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing blistering lesions that primarily affect the skin and mucous and membranes. In autoimmune blistering diseases, antibodies erroneously attack proteins that are essential for the layers of skin to stick (adhere) together. The specific symptoms and severity of blistering diseases vary from one person to another, even among individuals with the same disorder. In some cases, blistering lesions can cover a significant portion of the skin. Although there is no cure for autoimmune blistering diseases, they can often be controlled with treatment. In other cases, autoimmune blistering diseases if left untreated can eventually cause life-threatening complications. In recent years, new insight into the causes and development of these disorders has led to research into new therapies such as the development of drugs that target the specific antibodies which cause the symptoms of these diseases. NORD has individual reports on many of the specific disorders classified as autoimmune blistering diseases. For more information, choose the specific disease name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database. Autoimmune blistering diseases affect men and women in equal numbers. Most forms occur in middle-aged individuals, usually people in their 50s and 60s. However, autoimmune blistering diseases can affect individuals of any age including children.

{"id": "Wildervanck-Syndrome", "text": "\"Wildervanck syndrome, also known as cervicooculoacoustic syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects females. The disorder is characterized by a skeletal condition known as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS); abnormalities of certain eye (ocular) movements (i.e., Duane syndrome); and/or hearing impairment that is present at birth (congenital). In individuals with KFS, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). Duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or \"\"drawing back\"\" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus). In some affected individuals, additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In most cases, Wildervanck syndrome appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). As mentioned above, Wildervanck syndrome primarily affects females. Since the disorder was originally described in 1952 (L.S. Wildervanck), almost 90 cases have been reported in the medical literature. According to some reports, approximately one percent of females with hearing impairment may be affected by Wildervanck syndrome. Wildervanck syndrome may be detected at birth or during the first year of life based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized tests. Diagnostic studies may include advanced imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of internal structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to form detailed cross-sectional images of certain organs and tissues. Such techniques may help to detect and characterize abnormalities of the inner ear, union or fusion of certain bones of the spinal column (e.g., cervical vertebrae), possible impingement of vertebrae on the spinal cord, or other abnormalities potentially associated with the disorder. In addition, in some individuals with Wildervanck syndrome, exploratory surgery may be conducted to detect malformations of the middle ear (exploratory tympanotomy).

{"id": "Froelich-Syndrome", "text": "Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision \u2013 due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus \u2013  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin.

Hair follicles in the affected area can become secondarily damaged, resulting in hair loss. The exact cause of Fox-Fordyce disease is unknown.

Some reports place the ration of affected women to men at 9:1. The incidence of Fox-Fordyce disease is unknown. Heat, humidity, stress and exercise have been noted as exacerbating factors. In addition, Fox-Fordyce disease may be more severe during menstruation and tends to disappear (spontaneously resolve) during pregnancy. Fox-Fordyce disease was first described in the medical literature in 1902. A diagnosis of Fox-Fordyce disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (i.e., papular eruptions on apocrine gland areas), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation.

{"id": "Nephrogenic-Systemic-Fibrosis", "text": "Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare disorder that occurs in some individuals with reduced kidney function, who have been exposed to an intravenous contrast material that contains gadolinium. A contrast material is a dye that is sometimes used during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The term, fibrosis, refers to the thickening and scarring of connective tissue, most often the consequence of inflammation or injury. NSF is characterized by thickening and hardening (fibrosis) of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and, sometimes, underlying skeletal muscle. The arms and legs are most often affected. In some cases, the skin on the trunk can also become involved. This proliferation of fibrotic tissue may become systemic, extending to other areas including the smooth, delicate membrane that surrounds the lungs (pleura), the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), the thin sheet of muscle that aids respiration by moving up and down when breathing (diaphragm), and the outermost layer (dura mater) of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnostic criteria for NSF have been recently developed.

{"id": "Penta-X-Syndrome", "text": "\"Penta X Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects females. Females normally have two X chromosomes. However, in those with Penta X Syndrome, there are three additional (or a total of five) X chromosomes in the nuclei of body cells (pentasomy X). The condition is typically characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation, short stature, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or other physical abnormalities. Characteristic craniofacial malformations may include upslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a flat nasal bridge, malformed ears, a short neck with a low hairline, and/or other findings. Penta X Syndrome may also be characterized by abnormal deviation (clinodactyly) or permanent flexion (camptodactyly) of the \"\"pinkies\"\" or fifth fingers; heart and/or kidney defects; deficient development of the ovaries and uterus; and/or other physical findings. The disorder results from errors during the division of reproductive cells in one of the parents. Penta X Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects only females.  Since the syndrome was originally described in 1963 (Kesaree N), over 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Some females with Penta X Syndrome were originally thought to be affected by Down Syndrome due to the presence of certain features sometimes associated with the latter disorder.  (For further information, please see the \u201cRelated Disorders\u201d section of this report below.) Penta X Syndrome is diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination; detection of characteristic physical findings; and chromosomal analysis that confirms the presence of three extra X chromosomes in body cells. In some instances, the abnormality may be detected before birth (prenatally) based on chromosomal analysis following certain procedures, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). During amniocentesis, a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing fetus is removed and analyzed, while CVS involves the removal of tissue samples from a portion of the placenta.\"", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["chromosomal disorder", [28, 47]], ["chromosomal disorder", [1037, 1056]]], "rare_disease": [["Penta X Syndrome", [1, 16]], ["Penta X Syndrome", [135, 150]], ["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["Penta X Syndrome", [1010, 1025]], ["Penta X Syndrome", [1230, 1245]], ["Down Syndrome", [1289, 1301]], ["Penta X Syndrome", [1483, 1498]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["moderate to severe mental retardation", [302, 338]], ["short stature", [341, 353]], ["malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region", [356, 414]], ["physical abnormalities", [430, 451]], ["craniofacial malformations", [469, 494]], ["palpebral fissures", [533, 550]], ["flat nasal bridge", [556, 572]], ["malformed ears", [575, 588]], ["short neck with a low hairline", [593, 622]], ["clinodactyly", [714, 725]], ["camptodactyly", [750, 762]], ["heart and/or kidney defects", [802, 828]], ["kidney defects", [815, 828]], ["deficient development of the ovaries", [831, 866]], ["deficient development of the ovaries and uterus", [831, 877]]], "anaphor": [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["The disorder", [912, 923]], ["the syndrome", [1092, 1103]], ["latter disorder", [1373, 1387]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["The condition", [258, 270]], ["moderate to severe mental retardation", [302, 338]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["short stature", [341, 353]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region", [356, 414]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["physical abnormalities", [430, 451]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["craniofacial malformations", [469, 494]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["palpebral fissures", [533, 550]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["flat nasal bridge", [556, 572]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["malformed ears", [575, 588]]], [["The condition", [258, 270]], ["short neck with a low hairline", [593, 622]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["clinodactyly", [714, 725]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["camptodactyly", [750, 762]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["heart and/or kidney defects", [802, 828]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["kidney defects", [815, 828]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["deficient development of the ovaries", [831, 866]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["deficient development of the ovaries and uterus", [831, 877]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Penta X Syndrome", [1, 16]], ["deficient development of the ovaries and uterus", [831, 877]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [1010, 1025]], ["chromosomal disorder", [1037, 1056]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Penta X Syndrome", [648, 663]], ["The disorder", [912, 923]]], [["Penta X Syndrome", [1010, 1025]], ["the syndrome", [1092, 1103]]], [["Down Syndrome", [1289, 1301]], ["latter disorder", [1373, 1387]]]]}}}
{"id": "Long-QT-Syndrome", "text": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by abnormalities of the heart\u2019s electrical conduction system, and is characterized on the electrocardiogram (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) by prolongation of the QT interval that corresponds to prolongation of the recovery phase or repolarization of the heart muscle (ventricular myocardium) after each heartbeat. QT prolongation predisposes those affected to an increased risk of life threatening sudden alterations in the cardiac rhythm, (termed arrhythmias), specifically torsade de pointes (TdP) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias can lead to sudden loss of consciousness (syncope), cardiac arrest and potentially cause sudden cardiac death. The severity of cardiac symptoms varies greatly from one person to another, even among family members who carry the same rare genetic variant. Some individuals may have no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) for their entire lives, whilst others develop arrhythmias resulting in episodes of syncope, and cardiac arrest, at a young age. Several different factors are known to trigger the onset of symptoms including physical activity, excitement and fright, although cardiac events may occur while asleep or at rest. Long QT syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers and has been identified in all ethnic groups. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is not known.

There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures.

Symptoms and findings associated with ZES may include mild to severe abdominal pain; diarrhea; increased amounts of fat in the stools (steatorrhea); and/or other abnormalities. In most affected individuals, ZES appears to develop randomly (sporadically) for unknown reasons. In approximately 25 percent of patients, ZES occurs in association with a genetic syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1).

This condition is usually triggered by allergic reactions to insect bites, sensitivity to drugs, or other environmental causes. In some cases, swelling of the soft tissues of the face, neck, and hands (angioedema) may also occur. Acute papular urticaria and angioedema are essentially exaggerated allergic reactions limited to the skin and tissues just under the skin (subcutaneous tissues).  The reaction may be caused by a drug allergy, by insect stings or bites, by desensitization injections (allergy shots) or ingestion of certain foods (particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts or fruits) by people who are allergic to these substances.  In some cases (such as reactions to strawberries), the reaction may occur only after overindulgence, and possibly result from direct toxic histamine release into the blood.  If acute angioedema is recurrent, progressive, and never associated with urticaria, a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be suspected.

{"id": "Sheehan-Syndrome", "text": "Excessive blood loss during or after delivery of a baby may affect the function of the pituitary gland, leading to a form of maternal hypopituitarism known as Sheehan syndrome (SS). Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called \"shock\") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the \"shock\" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland's cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known.

{"id": "Retinopathy-of-Prematurity", "text": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease affecting the retinas in premature infants. The retinas are the light-sensitive linings of the insides of the eyes. In infants born prematurely, the blood vessels that supply the retinas are not yet completely developed. Although blood vessel growth continues after birth, these vessels may develop in an abnormal, disorganized pattern, known as ROP. In some affected infants, the changes associated with ROP spontaneously subside. However, in others, ROP may lead to bleeding, scarring of the retina, retinal detachment and visual loss. Even in cases in which ROP changes cease or regress spontaneously, affected children may have an increased risk of certain eye (ocular) abnormalities, including nearsightedness, misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), and/or future retinal detachment. The two major risk factors for ROP are a low birth weight and premature delivery. ROP is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in infants in many industrialized and \u201cmiddle-income\u201d countries. As noted above, an increased incidence of ROP in the 1940s and 1950s was shown to be due to the use of high concentrations of supplemental oxygen in premature infants. The number of cases decreased with measures to monitor oxygen blood levels carefully. However, with modern advances in care and technology in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), the incidence of ROP has increased as more premature infants of lower birth weights survive.

This disease has 3 stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The symptoms of the catarrhal stage are mild and may go unnoticed. The paroxysmal stage of Pertussis is characterized by episodes of coughing with a distinctive \"\"whooping\"\" sound when breathing in (inspiration). This characteristic cough gives the disease its common name, Whooping Cough. During the convalescent stage, episodes of coughing are less frequent and symptoms improve. The incidence of Pertussis has diminished greatly with widespread use of the DPT vaccine (Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus), but in certain areas of the United States outbreaks have occurred periodically in recent years. Pertussis is an infectious disease caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus, Bordetella pertussis.  Pertussis is a highly contagious disease via droplets in the air from the respiratory tract of infected individuals.  Transmission occurs during the catarrhal stage and during the first 2 to 3 weeks of the paroxysmal phase. The diagnosis of Pertussis may be confirmed by isolating the organism Bordetella pertussis from the sputum of an affected individual. These sputum samples are best obtained using a cotton swab that is placed through the nose into the rear portion of the throat (posterior pharynx).

The symptoms of this syndrome vary from person to person based the size and location of the missing piece of chromosome 4. WHS is an extremely rare disorder. Studies undertaken about 25 years ago suggested that the disorder occurred in approximately 1 in about 50,000 live births with a female to male ratio of 2:1. More recent studies suggest that the frequency of the disorder is underestimated because of misdiagnosis. A diagnosis of WHS may be suggested by the characteristic facial appearance, growth failure, developmental delays, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of a deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) by cytogenetic (chromosome) analysis.  Conventional cytogenetic analysis detects less than half of the deletions that cause WHS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a WHSCR probe has much better detection rate than standard karyotype and will detect most patients.

SCLS has been recognized in a range of racial backgrounds and nationalities. Although the cause of SCLS is not yet known, there appears to be no genetic predisposition to the disease. There are less than 100 patients reported in the world literature since its first description in 1960 by Clarkson. SCLS seems to occur more often in males and older adults. The disease may be more frequent than the literature suggests because the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. SCLS may be mistaken for a severe infection such as septic shock or toxic shock syndrome.  Some features such as the swelling may lead one to suspect heart failure or kidney disease. C-1 esterase inhibitor deficiency syndrome may present with a type of recurring edema called angioedema and is often thought of in patients presenting with SCLS.

Patients experience reduced menstrual flow, increased cramping and abdominal pain, eventual cessation of menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), and, in many instances, infertility.

Endometrial scarring and intrauterine adhesions may occur as a result of surgical scraping or cleaning of tissue from the uterine wall (dilatation and curettage [D and C]), infections of the endometrium (e.g., tuberculosis), or other factors. Asherman\u2019s syndrome is limited to females. Unless the physician is careful, the diagnosis of Asherman's syndrome may be needlessly overlooked.

{"id": "Fascioliasis", "text": "Fascioliasis is a rare infectious disorder caused by parasites. These parasites are liver flukes that live in plant-eating animals. Liver flukes can be found on water plants in certain parts of the world. When the parasite invades the liver, bile passages may be blocked. A subdivision of Fascioliasis called Halzoun Syndrome affects the throat (pharynx). This infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment. The disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  The acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  Symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  The latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  Individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  The chronic phase can persist for several years.  Symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness. Fascioliasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worms of the genus Fasciola, of which \u201cFasciola hepatica\u201d, found in temperate climates, and \u201cFasciola gigantica\u201d, found in tropical climates, are the most common.  Encysted parasitic larvae of these parasites live on water plants, such as watercress, that may be eaten by man or eaten by animals that subsequently are eaten by man.  Once ingested, the larvae escape from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate across the intestinal wall into the abdominal cavity.  They transform into immature worms and, once they reach the liver, move around for up to six weeks, feeding on liver tissue.  Eventually, they take up residence in the bile ducts, where they cause lesions and chronic liver disease.  Generally, the parasite can be killed by adequate cooking of foods before they are eaten. Liver fluke disease should be suspected if the patient recently spent time in a region where infection is prevalent in animals and/or humans. Patients usually report eating wild watercress, algae, or other aquatic plants. Acute and chronic infection can be confirmed by testing that detects liver fluke-specific antibodies in body fluids.

{"id": "Necrotizing-Enterocolitis", "text": "Onset of NEC is typically during the first several weeks after birth when feeds have been started, and the age of onset inversely related to gestational age at birth. Early in the disease process, neonates can exhibit signs of feeding intolerance with vomiting, increased gastric aspirates, bile-tinged (green) gastric aspirates, or decreased bowel sounds with abdominal distention and tenderness. Gross or occult blood can be present in stools indicating mucosal injury. Many of these signs are non-specific and can occur with other disorders. Progression of NEC results in systemic signs such as lethargy, long pauses in breathing called apnea, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (pumping of fluid through an organ or tissue.) Ultimately this can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. A palpable mass and erythema (abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion, as in inflammation) of the abdominal wall is indicative of a more advanced disease process. NEC affects 5 to 10% of premature infants born weighing less than 1500 g. Among the risk factors defined for NEC, prematurity and birth weight remain inversely related to risk for NEC. Term infants who develop NEC usually have specific risk factors such as congenital heart disease, sepsis, and low blood pressure. Many other gastrointestinal diseases can mimic NEC, so when evaluating a patient it is important to consider and treat alternative etiologies. Sepsis can cause an ileus with abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. Premature infants, especially those on indomethacin or steroids can also present with spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). SIP is characterized by isolated perforation of the distal small bowel. Other causes of severe abdominal distention in neonates include bowel obstruction from Hirshsprung\u2019s disease, small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, and malrotation with volvulus. NEC can also be mistaken for allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow\u2019s milk protein allergy. NEC is diagnosed clinically and radiographically. Once clinical suspicion arises, an abdominal X-ray is performed as an initial evaluation. This is repeated serially depending on acuity and clinical course to assess disease progression. Characteristic findings on NEC process on abdominal radiographs include pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), abnormal persistent dilated loops, thickened bowel wall, pneumoperitoneum and portal vein gas. Pneumoperitoneum defined as abdominal free air is a surgical emergency indicating bowel perforation and usually requires intervention.

In the case of Banti syndrome, the spleen rapidly but prematurely destroys blood cells. Banti syndrome may occur due to a number of different factors causing obstruction of, and abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension) within, certain veins of the spleen (splenic veins) or the liver (e.g., hepatic or portal veins).  These may include abnormalities present at birth (congenital) of such veins, blood clots, or various underlying disorders causing inflammation and obstruction of veins (vascular obstruction) of the liver, such as cirrhosis.  Increased arsenic intake has also been implicated in some cases.  Also, cases have occurred in patients taking long-term azathioprine, particularly after kidney transplantation. Banti syndrome affects males and females equally.  It is relatively common in parts of India and Japan, but rare in Western countries.  Increased arsenic levels are present in drinking water in some countries and may contribute to regional differences in incidence. The diagnosis of Banti syndrome my be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests, particularly advanced imaging techniques such as a splenic venography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

{"id": "Retinoblastoma", "text": "Although retinoblastoma is a rare disorder, it is the most common cancer of the eye in children, accounting for about 3% of all childhood malignancies.

The age-adjusted annual incidence for children aged 0-4 in the United States is 10-14 children per 1,000,000. This equates to about 1 in 14,000-18,000 live births. Incidence is the number of newly diagnosed people with a disorder identified in a given year. Two-thirds of children are affected before the age of 2 and more than 90% of retinoblastomas become apparent before the age of five years. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, the identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. The presenting symptom is usually leukocoria. A complete examination of the interior of the eye (fundoscopic examination under anesthesia \u2013 EUA) may be performed to locate the presence of a tumor or tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) may be used to determine the extent of the tumor(s) and determine if the tumor has spread to surrounding structures or tissue.

{"id": "Appendiceal-Cancer-and-Tumors", "text": "Appendiceal cancer is very rare with approximately 1-2 cases per 1 million individuals. Appendiceal cancers can occur at any age, with the peak occurrence in the 6th decade (average age of 50 at diagnosis). Most studies report that men and women are affected in equal numbers, while a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers.

{"id": "Giant-Cell-Arteritis", "text": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common blood vessel disorder in persons over 50 years old that causes inflammation of medium and large-sized arteries in the body (vasculitis). GCA causes changes in blood vessel walls leading to poor blood circulation. Arteries most affected in giant cell arteritis are the temporal artery and other cranial arteries (now called cranial-GCA), but inflammation of the aorta and other large arteries in the body can occur as well and may present differently (now called large vessel-GCA). If left untreated, this can lead to a medical emergency where sudden blindness occurs without early detection and treatment. Signs and symptoms when the temporal or other cranial arteries are involved include arm pain, pulsing headaches on one side or on the back of the head, jaw pain, scalp tenderness, double vision or other visual disturbances, bulging temporal artery that is tender with skin edema and redness. It can also present with constitutional symptoms such as polymyalgia, fevers, anorexia, and weight loss, a presentation of LV-GCA. The cause of giant cell arteritis is still unknown but is thought to be from the immune system causing damage to the body\u2019s own blood vessels. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that is closely related to giant cell arteritis and occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with giant call arteritis. 15% to 20% of persons with polymyalgia rheumatica will have giant cell arteritis. Treatments available include steroids (corticosteroids) that will help with symptoms and reoccurrence and medications that weaken the immune system. Giant cell arteritis most commonly affects those over 50 years old (mostly above 65 years) and is more common in Caucasians, people of Nordic or northern European descent, and others in northern latitudes.

{"id": "Felty-Syndrome", "text": "Felty syndrome is usually described as associated with or a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. This disorder is generally defined by the presence of three conditions: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an enlarged spleen (spenomelgaly) and a low white blood cell count (neutropenia). The presence of RA gives rise to painful, stiff and swollen joints. A low white blood cell count, especially when accompanied by an abnormally large spleen, leads to a greater chance for infections. Other symptoms associated with Felty syndrome may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and/or discoloration of patches of skin (brown pigmentation). The exact cause of Felty syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be an autoimmune disorder that may be genetically transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis are affected by Felty syndrome.  This is a large number, but most of these go undiagnosed.  The disorder is about three times more common in women than in men.  Felty syndrome is not found as frequently among those of African descent as among Caucasian populations. The disorder generally affects persons 50 to 70 years of age.

{"id": "Myelodysplastic-Syndromes", "text": "When the cause of MDS is unknown it is called idiopathic MDS. A so-called secondary MDS can develop after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer or autoimmune diseases It is possible that some chemicals (pesticides and benzene), cigarette smoking, and possibly viral infections can predispose to MDS. However, these links are circumstantial and in the majority of individuals developing MDS no obvious connection with environmental hazards can be found. MDS sometimes runs in families, suggesting a genetic link with the disease, but apart from an association with a rare congenital form of anemia (Fanconi aplastic anemia), no definite MDS provoking gene has been found. Myelodysplastic syndromes affect males slightly more often than females. The disorder occurs in any age group, but is far more common in older adults, occurring most often in individuals over 60 years of age. According to one estimate, 22 to 45 per 100,000 people over the age of 70 years have MDS. Approximately 20,000 new patients are diagnosed each year in the United States. The number of new cases diagnosed each year is increasing, possibly due to better recognition of the disorder combined with an increasing proportion of elderly adults in the general population. Determining the exact frequency of MDS in the general population is difficult because of lack of reporting of patients with mild cytopenias A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests including complete blood counts, examination of the blood smear (often more than one is needed), and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

Such craniofacial abnormalities may include a relatively short head (brachycephaly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), upwardly slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and a small nose with upturned nostrils (anteverted nares). Affected infants and children also tend to have long eyelashes; arched, bushy, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys), an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and generalized excessive hair growth (hirsutism).

{"id": "Urachal-Cancer", "text": "Urachal cancer is a form of cancer that arises in a structure called the urachus. The urachus is a canal that exists when the fetus is developing before birth. This canal runs from the bladder of the fetus to the belly button (umbilicus). It drains the urinary bladder of the fetus. Between the fourth and fifth month of pregnancy, this canal breaks down (degenerates) into a fibrous band of tissue called a ligament. This ligament runs from the belly button to the top of the bladder and is called the median umbilical ligament. Sometimes, there are tissue remnants of the urachus in adults (about 1/3 of adults have urachal tissue remnants). This usually does not cause any problems. However, sometimes these remnants can potentially become cancerous (malignant). Urachal cancer will often extend into surrounding structures like the bladder, and can potentially spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. The exact, underlying cause of urachal cancer is not fully understood. Surgery is the most common treatment option. Urachal cancer is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence of this form of cancer in the general population is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Urachal cancer accounts for less than 1% of bladder cancers.

{"id": "Follicular-Lymphoma", "text": "\"Follicular lymphoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which is a group of related cancers that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). The lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) and other foreign bodies. Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including, but not limited to, the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymphocytes are stored within lymph nodes and may also be found in other lymphatic tissues. In addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Lymphatic tissue or circulating lymphocytes may also be located in other regions of the body. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes (B-cells), which may produce specific antibodies to \"\"neutralize\"\" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes (T-cells), which may directly destroy microorganisms or cancer cells, or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. Follicular lymphoma affects both men and women, but is slightly more common in women. This form of cancer is found all over the world and can affect people of all races. It is less common in individuals of Asian or African heritage than it is in other ethnicities. The mean age at diagnosis is 65. In the United States and Western Europe, follicular lymphoma is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for about 30%-35% of people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and almost 75% of people with indolent forms of lymphoma. Each year, 15-20,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Pediatric follicular lymphoma is extremely rare variant that makes up only 1-2% of all malignant lymphomas in children.

Other symptoms including muscles cramps and wasting (atrophy) of muscles can also occur. The term multifocal means arising from two or more spots. The term motor refers to the motor nerves, which are those that carry nerve impulses from the brain to the muscles. The exact, underlying cause of this disorder is not fully understood. The disorder is acquired at some point during a person\u2019s life; a person is not born with the disorder. Multifocal motor neuropathy usually responds to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Multifocal motor neuropathy affects both men and women, although men are more frequently affected than women by a ratio of about 2.7:1. Men also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age. The median age of onset is 40 years old, although the disorder has been reported individuals ranging from 20-80 years of age.

Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used.

{"id": "Glycogen-Storage-Disease-Type-VII", "text": "Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells.

{"id": "Rasmussen-Encephalitis", "text": "Rasmussen encephalitis, sometimes referred to as Rasmussen syndrome, is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by chronic progressive inflammation (encephalitis) of one cerebral hemisphere. As a result, the patient usually experiences frequent episodes of uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that cause epileptic seizures (epilepsy), and progressive cerebral destruction. With time, further symptoms may include progressive weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), language problems (if on the left side of the brain) and intellectual disabilities. The exact cause of this disorder is not known. The two leading ideas are that the brain inflammation might be a reaction of a foreign antigen (infection) or an autoimmune disease limited to one side of the brain resulting in brain damage. It occurs mostly, but not always, in children between the ages of two and ten years, and in many patients the course of the disease is most severe during the first 8 to 12 months. After the peak inflammatory response is reached, the progression of this disorder appears to slow or stop and the patient is left with permanent neurological deficits. Rasmussen encephalitis mostly affects children ten years of age and younger. It is unusual to affect children under two years of age. Adolescents and young adults in much smaller proportions are also affected. There may be a history of some prior mild cold or flu prior to the onset of the seizures.

In the USA, this disorder accounts for an extremely small percentage (0.1% to 0.4%) of all infants with congenital heart disease. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum is usually made by using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (EC). In another procedure known as a cardiac catheterization, a long fine tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and then channeled directly into the heart. This allows the physician to further identify heart defects and to determine the rates of blood flow through the heart.

{"id": "Rapid", "text": "Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder of respiratory control and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, with endocrine system abnormalities. Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively \u201cnew\u201d disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the \u201cautomatic\u201d control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep \u2013 despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) \u2013 allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS).

{"id": "Carcinoid-Syndrome", "text": "The underlying cause of carcinoid tumors remains unclear. Some studies have suggested risk factors such as smoking and dietary intake, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. In the majority of cases tumors are slow-growing and can produce hormonal chemical substances such as serotonin, bradykinins, tachykinins and prostaglandins. If the original carcinoid cells spread (metastasize) to the liver, these substances are no longer broken down to their inactive form and are released into the systemic (main) circulation, causing the signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. When tumors affect organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the ovaries, carcinoid syndrome can occur in the absence of liver metastases. Carcinoid tumors are rare, with only 27 new cases per million diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Of these, only about 10% will develop carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. All races can be affected though there is a slightly increased prevalence in black African males. All ages can be affected but most gastrointestinal cases occur in middle-age. Bronchial (airway) tumors are most often seen in the fifth decade but can affect people at any age. Carcinoid syndrome may be more prevalent than suspected because diagnosis is difficult and sometimes overlooked; some patients may not exhibit all three of the hallmark symptoms of flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is best achieved with a multimodality approach including biochemical investigation, radiological and nuclear imaging, and finally histological (tissue biopsy) confirmation where possible. The occurrence of episodic facial flushing and/or chronic diarrhea not diagnosed by standard tests as being a result of more common causes should lead to suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. In the past, measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyendolacetic acid (5-HIAA), a product of the breakdown (metabolism) of serotonin, in a patient on a low serotonin diet was the main lab test used. It is still useful and the level of 5-HIAA will be clearly elevated in 50% of the cases. However, there are also blood tests available, the most useful being chromogranin-A, often in combination with an imaging technique known as octreoscan, that may confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome even when urinary 5-HIAA is normal. This technique may also be helpful in indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors when the full spectrum of symptoms is not apparent. Other investigations that may be helpful, depending on the location of the primary tumor, include CT scan, ultrasound, MRI and endoscopy. Sometimes the diagnosis is established incidentally at the time of surgery for another suspected condition such as intestinal obstruction or appendicitis.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["intestinal obstruction", [2764, 2785]], ["appendicitis", [2790, 2801]]], "rare_disease": [["carcinoid syndrome", [578, 595]], ["carcinoid syndrome", [684, 701]], ["carcinoid syndrome", [881, 898]], ["Carcinoid syndrome", [1234, 1251]], ["carcinoid syndrome", [1814, 1831]], ["carcinoid syndrome", [2322, 2339]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["carcinoid tumors", [24, 39]], ["tumors", [603, 608]], ["Carcinoid tumors", [749, 764]], ["Bronchial (airway) tumors", [1134, 1158]], ["flushing", [1415, 1422]], ["wheezing", [1425, 1432]], ["diarrhea", [1439, 1446]], ["episodic facial flushing", [1665, 1688]], ["chronic diarrhea", [1697, 1712]], ["level of 5-HIAA will be clearly elevated", [2073, 2112]], ["carcinoid tumors", [2442, 2457]]], "anaphor": [["The syndrome", [901, 912]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["carcinoid syndrome", [578, 595]], ["carcinoid tumors", [24, 39]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [684, 701]], ["tumors", [603, 608]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [881, 898]], ["Carcinoid tumors", [749, 764]]], [["The syndrome", [901, 912]], ["Bronchial (airway) tumors", [1134, 1158]]], [["Carcinoid syndrome", [1234, 1251]], ["flushing", [1415, 1422]]], [["Carcinoid syndrome", [1234, 1251]], ["wheezing", [1425, 1432]]], [["Carcinoid syndrome", [1234, 1251]], ["diarrhea", [1439, 1446]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [1814, 1831]], ["episodic facial flushing", [1665, 1688]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [1814, 1831]], ["chronic diarrhea", [1697, 1712]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [1814, 1831]], ["level of 5-HIAA will be clearly elevated", [2073, 2112]]], [["carcinoid syndrome", [2322, 2339]], ["carcinoid tumors", [2442, 2457]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["carcinoid syndrome", [881, 898]], ["The syndrome", [901, 912]]]]}}}
{"id": "Giant-Axonal-Neuropathy", "text": "Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare neuropathy that severely affects the peripheral as well as the central nervous system. The first symptoms appear in early childhood. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski\u2019s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent\u2019s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade. Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disorder that presents in early childhood. This disorder affects equal numbers of males and females. The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of \"giant axons\" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments. Molecular genetic testing for abnormalities in the GAN gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.

{"id": "Amniotic-Fluid-Embolism", "text": "Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is an extremely rare, but life-threatening complication that affects pregnant women shortly before, during, or immediately following labor and childbirth. Most instances occur during labor. In this disorder, it is hypothesized that a pregnant woman has a severe, allergic reaction to amniotic fluid or other fetal material such as fetal cells, which enter the mother\u2019s bloodstream. Amniotic fluid is contained within the amniotic sac. This fluid supports, cushions, and protects a developing fetus. Amniotic fluid embolism is unpredictable and no risk factors have been identified.  AFE can cause a severe, rapid decline in the mother\u2019s health. For years, some researchers believed that the amniotic fluid and fetal cells cause obstruction within the mother\u2019s blood vessels, but now most researchers believe that the mother\u2019s immune system reacts to the amniotic fluid and fetal cells causing an overwhelming immune system response, which ends up harming the mother and the fetus. Breathing problems, cardiac arrest, and excessive bleeding are some of the life-threatening complications that can occur. Researchers and physicians do not fully understand why amniotic fluid or fetal cells entering the mother\u2019s bloodstream causes this reaction in some women. Amniotic fluid embolism is a medical emergency that develops suddenly and rapidly and can be fatal. Early recognition and prompt supportive treatment are essential. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare complication that occurs just before, during, or immediately after birth. The number of women who have experienced this complication is unknown.

{"id": "Biliary-Atresia", "text": "Biliary atresia is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by destruction or absence of all or a portion of the bile duct that lies outside the liver (extrahepatic bile duct). The bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. Bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. In biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver. Affected infants have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and scarring of the liver (fibrosis). In some cases, additional abnormalities may be present, including heart defects and intestinal, spleen and kidney malformations. The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown. Biliary atresia is a rare disorder with a slight increased frequency in females. It occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 births in the United States. Approximately 400-600 new cases of biliary atresia are encountered in the United States each year. According to one estimate, the prevalence of biliary atresia in Europe is approximately 1 in 12,000 births. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. The diagnosis of biliary atresia requires a direct examination of the bile ducts by abdominal surgery (laparotomy) and the microscopic examination of tissue from the liver (liver biopsy). During the surgery special contrast dye is injected into the gallbladder and x-ray films are taken to outline how the dye fills the major bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiogram). These films show the movement (or lack of movement) of the dye through bile ducts and into the small intestine. The physician/surgeon is then able to evaluate the structure of the bile ducts and to determine the site of the blockage (proximal or distal).

The main artery of the heart (aorta) and the pulmonary (lung) artery, among others, may be affected. When this disorder causes progressive inflammation of many arteries, it is known as polyarteritis. One of the consequences of polyarteritis is the reduction of blood flow to any of several organs and/or arms and legs. Arteries in the head and arms may be affected, and this can result in the loss of the major pulse points in the body. Some people with Takayasu arteritis have irregular narrowing of portions of the large arteries (segmental stenosis) and abnormal backward flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle of the heart (aortic regurgitation). Other patients may have symptoms of ballooning and weakening (aneurysm) of the wall of a major vessel. Takayasu arteritis is a rare disorder that affects more females than males.

{"id": "Gastrointestinal-Stromal-Tumors", "text": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) belong to a group of cancers known as soft tissue sarcomas. The number of new cases in the United States annually has been estimated to be 5,000-6,000. Tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. There are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). There are also case reports of tumors arising in the appendix and/or pancreas. These tumors most commonly present with abdominal pain, bleeding or signs of intestinal obstruction. They spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. Some GISTs are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. Most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, KIT or PDGFR, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. There are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). Most cases arise in older adults. Leiomyosarcomas of the intestinal tract arise in a similar location and can be confused with GIST. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. There are essentially two types of muscles in the body \u2013 voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles \u2013 the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. Smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. Smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. Leiomyosarcoma usually spreads via the bloodstream. It is very rare to see it in lymphatics. Since smooth muscle is found all over the body, a leiomyosarcoma can form almost anywhere where there are blood vessels, heart, liver, pancreas, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract, the space behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum), uterus, skin. The uterus is the most common location for a leiomyosarcoma. Most leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are now reclassified as GISTs. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown.

Hiccups are unmistakable, and rarely taken for anything else.  They often start for no apparent reason, and usually go away on their own in a few minutes.  Of concern is the period of time required for an episode to run its course.   Hiccups that persist over a period of time may cause exhaustion and weight loss from lack of sleep and the interruption of normal eating patterns. Hiccups affect males more often than females.  Hiccups occur in practically every human being, but chronic hiccups are very rare. There are many disorders involving the autonomic nervous system which controls unconscious activities of the body such as breathing, sweating, heartbeat, hiccups, coughing, etc. The diagnosis of chronic hiccups may be obvious, but blood, imaging, and other laboratory studies may be used to determine the underlying cause.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [], "rare_disease": [["chronic hiccups", [229, 243]], ["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["chronic hiccups", [1069, 1083]], ["chronic hiccups", [1295, 1309]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["hiccup", [2, 7]], ["hiccups", [159, 165]], ["persistent hiccups", [385, 402]], ["hiccups", [424, 430]], ["Hiccups", [589, 595]], ["Hiccups", [823, 829]], ["exhaustion", [876, 885]], ["weight loss", [891, 901]], ["lack of sleep", [908, 920]], ["interruption of normal eating patterns", [930, 967]], ["Hiccups", [970, 976]], ["Hiccups", [1017, 1023]], ["hiccups", [1254, 1260]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["chronic hiccups", [229, 243]], ["hiccup", [2, 7]]], [["chronic hiccups", [229, 243]], ["hiccups", [159, 165]]], [["chronic hiccups", [229, 243]], ["persistent hiccups", [385, 402]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["hiccups", [424, 430]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["Hiccups", [589, 595]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["Hiccups", [823, 829]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["exhaustion", [876, 885]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["weight loss", [891, 901]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["lack of sleep", [908, 920]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["interruption of normal eating patterns", [930, 967]]], [["chronic hiccups", [556, 570]], ["Hiccups", [970, 976]]], [["chronic hiccups", [1069, 1083]], ["Hiccups", [1017, 1023]]], [["chronic hiccups", [1069, 1083]], ["hiccups", [1254, 1260]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}}

New lysosomal storage disorders continue to be identified. While clinical trials are in progress on possible treatments for some of these diseases, there is currently no approved treatment for many lysosomal storage diseases. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are believed to have an estimated frequency of about one in every 5,000 live births.  Although the individual diseases are rare, the group together affects many people around the world.  Some of the diseases have a higher incidence in certain populations.

T. solium cysts (cysticerci) may affect any area of the body including the brain, a condition known as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms vary from case to case. If cysticerci are located in the brain, central nervous system abnormalities may occur, most often seizures and headaches. Cysticercosis may also affect the eyes, spinal cord, skin and heart. Cysticercosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Some forms of cysticercosis such as racemose cysticercosis occur more frequently in females. Approximately 1,000 cases of cysticercosis are reported each year in the United States. The disease is more common in Mexico, Latin America, South America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Cysticercosis cases have risen in the United States following increased immigration from endemic areas. Tapeworms can be acquired from various uncooked meats, including beef and fish, but only pork tapeworms appear to produce larvae capable of invading human muscle and forming cysts.

{"id": "Hypokalemia", "text": "Hypokalemia is a metabolic imbalance characterized by extremely low potassium levels in the blood. It is a symptom of another disease or condition, or a side effect of diuretic drugs. The body needs potassium for the contraction of muscles (including the heart), and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). Potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. The normal concentration of potassium in the body is regulated by the kidneys through the excretion of urine. When the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. Body chemicals and hormones such as aldosterone also regulate potassium balance. Secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced Hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. When Hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium. Hypokalemia may affect both males and females.  However, it occurs more commonly in females. The underlying cause of Hypokalemia must first be treated. When the hypokalemia is severe, potassium chloride may be administered orally or intravenously. Treatment must be carefully monitored by a physician. Any associated acid-base disorders or hormonal disturbances must be evaluated before treatment is planned. The administration of potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics is usually discouraged in patients with kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system. The imbalance of external and internal potassium levels in these individuals may predispose them to life-threatening degrees of Hyperkalemia (too much potassium). Hypokalemia in individuals with high blood pressure taking diuretics may be improved by replacing lost potassium in the diet through certain fruits or potassium drugs. Hypokalemia may also be minimized by dietary restriction of salt since high rates of sodium excretion promote urinary potassium losses. People who participate in vigorous sports or exercise in warm weather should be sure to replace potassium that is lost through excessive sweating. This can be accomplished through dietary planning.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["Hypokalemia", [0, 10]], ["Hypokalemia", [967, 977]], ["Hypokalemia", [1028, 1038]], ["Hypokalemia", [1204, 1214]], ["Hypokalemia", [1321, 1331]], ["hypokalemia", [1365, 1375]], ["kidney disease", [1718, 1731]], ["diabetes mellitus", [1734, 1750]], ["dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system", [1756, 1799]], ["Hyperkalemia", [1930, 1941]], ["Hypokalemia", [1965, 1975]], ["high blood pressure", [1997, 2015]], ["Hypokalemia", [2133, 2143]]], "rare_disease": [], "symptom_and_sign": [["low potassium levels in the blood", [64, 96]]], "anaphor": [["It", [99, 100]], ["it", [1261, 1262]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Hypokalemia", [0, 10]], ["low potassium levels in the blood", [64, 96]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Hypokalemia", [0, 10]], ["It", [99, 100]]], [["Hypokalemia", [1204, 1214]], ["it", [1261, 1262]]]]}}}

{"id": "Thyroid-Cancer", "text": "Thyroid cancer (carcinoma) is cancer affecting the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped structure located at the base of the neck. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system, the network of glands that secrete hormones that regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the body's activities as well as regulating the heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 64,300 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Of those cases, more than 49,350 will occur in women. In fact, thyroid cancer is now the 5th most common cancer in women. Thyroid cancer can affect individuals of any age and specific forms occur with greater frequency among different age groups. In general, thyroid nodules in children and adolescents are more likely may be malignant than those that occur in adults. In general, for unclear reasons, the rate of thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Some researchers believe that this increase in frequency is due to the greater use of imaging (CT scans, MRI), with the result being an increase in the rate of detection of small thyroid cancers that may not ever have been detected while the individual was alive. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 is a rare genetic cancer syndrome in which tumors develop in the endocrine glands (e.g., thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands). Two main subtypes exist called MEN 2A and MEN 2B. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is considered a third subtype.

{"id": "Filariasis", "text": "Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another.

{"id": "Ocular-Melanoma", "text": "Ocular melanoma is an extremely rare form of cancer that affects the eye with an incidence of 5 per million adults. Although rare, it is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. Primary means that the cancer began at that site (in this case the eye) and did not spread there from another part of the body. In most people, this cancer arises in a part of the eye known as the uveal tract. The uveal tract is the colored (pigmented) layer of tissue that is found beneath the white of the eye (sclera) and is composed of normally pigmented cells and blood vessels.  In the front of the eye, the uvea is made up of the colored part of the eye (iris) and a circle of muscle tissue (ciliary body) that releases a transparent fluid (aqueous humor) into the eye and helps to control the shape of the lens. The largest area of the uveal tract is in the back part of the eye (choroid) which is located beneath the retina, the vision sensing portion of the eye. In most instances, ocular melanomas arise within the choroid. Ocular melanoma arises from cells called melanocytes, which are the cells of the body that produce pigment. Ocular melanoma is a cancerous (malignant) tumor that can potentially spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most often to the liver. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified. Ocular melanoma is the most common primary cancer affecting the eye. However, it is a rare disorder and is estimated to be diagnosed in about 2,500 people in the United States each year. The incidence is unknown, but one estimate places it at about 5-6 people per every 1,000,000 people in the general population. This cancer can affect men and women and individuals of all ethnic or racial groups. It occurs most commonly in older individuals with the highest incidence in the seventh and eighth decade of life. However, ocular melanoma has been reported in children as well. The disorder occurs more often in people who are fair skinned and have lighter colored eyes. The rate of occurrence is 8-10 times higher in Caucasian individuals compared to people of African descent.

{"id": "Klinefelter-Syndrome", "text": "47, XXY (KS) is not inherited. Males with 47, XXY (KS) have one extra X chromosome because of a nondisjunction error that randomly occurs during the division of the sex chromosomes in the egg or sperm. Some males with 47, XXY (KS) are mosaic, meaning that some cells have an extra X chromosome and other cells do not. Mosaic 47, XXY (KS) occurs because of an error in the division of the sex chromosomes in the zygote after fertilization. The extra X chromosome typically results in primary testicular failure leading to androgen deficiency. 47, XXY (KS) is the most common human sex chromosome disorder and occurs in approximately 1 in 500-1,000 males. It is estimated that 3,000 affected boys are born each year in the United States. Kallmann syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that mostly, but not exclusively, affects men. The major characteristics of Kallmann syndrome, in both men and women, are the failure to experience puberty and the complete or partial loss of the sense of smell. Failure to go through puberty reflects a hormonal imbalance that is caused by a failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. Patients with Kallmann syndrome show evidence of small genitalia, sterile gonads that cannot produce the sex cells (hypogonadism), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). The impaired production of hormones as well as sperm and egg cells causes delayed puberty, growth and infertility. (For more information on this disorder, choose \u201cKallmann syndrome\u201d as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Males with 47, XXY (KS) are most commonly identified before birth (e.g. through prenatal screenings for chromosomal disorders), at puberty, or later in life because of infertility. 47, XXY (KS) is diagnosed by a chromosome karyotype analysis on a blood sample or by a chromosomal microarray (CMA) test. CMA consists of an oral cheek (buccal) swab and is an easy and painless way to detect abnormalities of chromosome numbers and provide a definitive diagnosis. 47, XXY (KS) can also be diagnosed prenatally on chorionic villous or amniotic fluid cells.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["inherited disorder", [764, 781]], ["hypogonadism", [1249, 1260]], ["delayed puberty", [1382, 1396]]], "rare_disease": [["47, XXY", [0, 6]], ["KS", [9, 10]], ["47, XXY", [42, 48]], ["KS", [51, 52]], ["47, XXY", [218, 224]], ["KS", [227, 228]], ["47, XXY", [325, 331]], ["KS", [334, 335]], ["47, XXY", [542, 548]], ["KS", [551, 552]], ["Kallmann syndrome", [736, 752]], ["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["Kallmann syndrome", [1471, 1487]], ["47, XXY", [1552, 1558]], ["KS", [1561, 1562]], ["47, XXY", [1722, 1728]], ["KS", [1731, 1732]], ["47, XXY", [2002, 2008]], ["KS", [2011, 2012]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["primary testicular failure", [483, 508]], ["androgen deficiency", [521, 539]], ["failure to experience puberty", [909, 937]], ["complete or partial loss of the sense of smell", [947, 992]], ["Failure to go through puberty", [995, 1023]], ["hormonal imbalance", [1036, 1053]], ["failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus", [1075, 1130]], ["hypogonadism", [1249, 1260]], ["anosmia", [1298, 1304]], ["impaired production of hormones", [1312, 1342]], ["delayed puberty", [1382, 1396]], ["delayed puberty, growth", [1382, 1404]], ["infertility", [1410, 1420]], ["infertility", [1709, 1719]]], "anaphor": [["It", [654, 655]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["47, XXY", [325, 331]], ["primary testicular failure", [483, 508]]], [["47, XXY", [325, 331]], ["androgen deficiency", [521, 539]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["failure to experience puberty", [909, 937]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["complete or partial loss of the sense of smell", [947, 992]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["Failure to go through puberty", [995, 1023]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["hormonal imbalance", [1036, 1053]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [859, 875]], ["failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus", [1075, 1130]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["hypogonadism", [1249, 1260]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["anosmia", [1298, 1304]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["impaired production of hormones", [1312, 1342]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["delayed puberty", [1382, 1396]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["delayed puberty, growth", [1382, 1404]]], [["Kallmann syndrome", [1147, 1163]], ["infertility", [1410, 1420]]], [["47, XXY", [1552, 1558]], ["infertility", [1709, 1719]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Kallmann syndrome", [736, 752]], ["inherited disorder", [764, 781]]]], "is_acron": [[["KS", [551, 552]], ["Kallmann syndrome", [736, 752]]]], "is_synon": [[["androgen deficiency", [521, 539]], ["delayed puberty, growth", [1382, 1404]]], [["KS", [51, 52]], ["infertility", [1410, 1420]]], [["KS", [227, 228]], ["47, XXY", [218, 224]]], [["KS", [334, 335]], ["47, XXY", [325, 331]]], [["KS", [551, 552]], ["47, XXY", [542, 548]]], [["KS", [1561, 1562]], ["47, XXY", [1552, 1558]]], [["KS", [1731, 1732]], ["47, XXY", [1722, 1728]]], [["KS", [2011, 2012]], ["47, XXY", [2002, 2008]]]], "anaphora": [[["47, XXY", [542, 548]], ["It", [654, 655]]]]}}}

{"id": "Prolactinoma", "text": "A prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland (adenoma) that produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. In women, hyperprolactinemia is characterized by irregular menstrual periods or even absence of periods, infertility and production of breast milk in women who are not pregnant (galactorrhea). The most common symptom in men is impotence. The cause of pituitary tumors is unknown. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic and not associated with genetic factors that are inherited or can be passed on to children. Pituitary tumors that produce enough prolactin to affect health occur in approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. All patients who are shown to have a pituitary adenoma on MRI or CT imaging should have a serum prolactin level checked and if their prolactin level is >150-200 ng/ml the patient likely harbors a prolactin secreting tumor which should be treated with a dopamine agonist medication rather than surgery. If the level is less, this could be due to a tumor <10 mm or lack of normal inhibition by hypothalamic dopamine which then permits the normal prolactin secreting cells to hypersecrete (stalk effect). The effect of certain medications, recreational drugs, macroprolactin (big prolactin molecule with no effect on the body), other medical conditions (like low thyroid function, hepatic or renal insufficiency) should be evaluated for these lower levels. A specialist consultation should be considered for such patients by an experienced endocrinologist. Prolactinoma is treated with medications that act like dopamine (dopamine agonists) such as bromocriptine, quinagolide and cabergoline because dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. These medications reduce the size of the tumor and reduce the amount of prolactin secretion in approximately 80-90% of patients. Surgery may be recommended if medical therapy is not effective or bothersome side effects (dizziness, mental fogginess, nausea, vomiting). For both medical therapy and surgery, cure rates depend on the size and location of the tumor and the prolactinoma can recur in some affected individuals.

{"id": "C3-Glomerulopathy_-Dense-Deposit-Disease-and-C3-Glomerulonephritis", "text": "Over the past decade, important advances in our understanding of complement-mediated renal diseases have led to the adoption of new names or \u2018disease categories\u2019 to more precisely group diseases that appear to share a similar cause. Consider, for example, dense deposit disease (DDD), a very rare kidney disease characterized on a renal biopsy test called \u2018immunofluorescence\u2019 by an abundance of a protein called C3 in the renal glomeruli, and named for the extremely dense \u2018sausage-like\u2019 deposits that are seen in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) using electron microscopy. In 2013, as a result of a consensus meeting, scientists recommended that DDD be sub-grouped under a new heading \u2013 C3 Glomerulopathy, abbreviated C3G. The adoption of this new term was driven by the recognition that there is another group of patients with glomerular disease whose kidney biopsy is reminiscent of DDD. On electron microscopy, the deposits in these patients are lighter in color and more widespread in location, but on immunofluorescence, as with DDD there is an abundance of C3 in the renal glomeruli. These patients are said to have C3 glomerulonephritis or C3GN.  In recognition of shared similarities, both DDD and C3GN are now classified as sub-types of C3G.

In such cases, a link to South Africa has been determined. The disorder is characterized by periodic attacks of red (erythematous) plaques that are distributed equally on both sides of the body. A layer of skin can be peeled from these plaques. Symptoms usually improve with age. The disorder tends to become worse with the cold weather. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis is characterized by periodic attacks of red skin plaques.  A thick layer of skin can be peeled off these plaques from the center outward.  As new skin forms, the plaques are pushed outward.  Symptoms may start during infancy or adolescence, and the disorder usually improves with age.  Only the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved in most cases.  However, the disorder may spread to the skin of the back or elsewhere on the body surface.  Appearance of new plaques may be precipitated by fever or surgery. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis primarily affects descendants of farmers from the Oudtshoorn district in South Africa.  This disorder starts during infancy or adolescence and usually improves after age 30. It is thought to affect males and females equally.

Bouts of extreme exhaustion may last for months after the initial symptoms. Dengue Fever is caused by a virus that belongs to a family of viruses known as Flaviviruses.   There is no vaccine, so travelers going to parts of the world where it is endemic during Dengue season (July to November) are urged to protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing and mosquito repellant. Dengue Fever occurs mainly in subtropical or tropical climates including southern Asia, South America (particularly Brazil), and the Caribbean including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The superior oblique tendon sheath of the superior oblique muscle surrounds the eyeball. The symptoms of Brown Syndrome are caused by abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. This results in the inability to move the affected eye upward. People with Brown Syndrome have limited eye movement in the affected eye. The ability to move the eyeball toward the center (adduction), or outward from the center (abduction), may be restricted or absent.  One eye may appear to be out of alignment with the unaffected eye, especially when looking upward.  The symptoms of Brown Syndrome may also include a droopy eyelid (ptosis), widening of the eye (palpebral fissure) when looking upward, crossing of the eyes (strabismus), and/or a backward head tilt.

{"id": "Restless-Legs-Syndrome", "text": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy).

{"id": "Fibromuscular-Dysplasia", "text": "Fibromuscular dysplasia, commonly called FMD, is a disease that causes one or more arteries in the body to have abnormal cell development in the artery wall. As a result, areas of narrowing (stenosis), aneurysms, or tears (dissection) may occur. If narrowing or a tear causes a decrease in blood flow through the artery, symptoms may result. FMD is most commonly found in the arteries that supply the kidneys with blood (renal arteries) and the arteries called the carotid and vertebral arteries which are found in the neck and supply the brain with blood. Less commonly, FMD affects the arteries in the abdomen (supplying the liver, spleen and intestines) and extremities (legs and arms). In more than one-half of people with this disease, there will be evidence of FMD in more than one artery. FMD affects women far more commonly than men, although men and children can be affected with this disease. In children with FMD, the disease seems to more commonly present with significant narrowing rather than tears of arteries and also seems to involve the arteries to the kidneys and intestines more commonly than the carotid vessels. In the pediatric population, FMD affects both boys and girls. The vascular subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV) has been associated with the most common type of fibromuscular dysplasia, known as multifocal FMD. This syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries in addition to the typical angiographic findings of fibromuscular dysplasia. There have been isolated reports of fibromuscular dysplasia associated with other disorders, including Alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Marfan syndrome, and moyamoya disease. (For more information on these disorders, search for the term in the Rare Disease Database.) In order to diagnosis FMD, a test must be done to image the blood vessels. There are many options for imaging the arteries, including specialized blood vessel ultrasound known as duplex ultrasound; a CAT scan of the arteries which is obtained after a dye is given through the veins, or a special type of MRI. In many cases, the diagnosis of FMD requires that a procedure known as an arteriogram be performed. Arteriography is a procedure that is performed by a radiologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular medicine specialist with appropriate training. It involves inserting a wire into or near the affected artery and injecting contrast material, a dye that can be detected by an X-ray machine. An X-ray of the affected area is then taken and examined. The individual is usually awake during an arteriogram procedure although medications may be given to keep her or him comfortable. This outpatient procedure usually lasts from one to two hours with a recovery period of up to six hours (this varies widely).", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [], "rare_disease": [["Fibromuscular dysplasia", [0, 22]], ["FMD", [41, 43]], ["FMD", [342, 344]], ["FMD", [572, 574]], ["FMD", [767, 769]], ["FMD", [796, 798]], ["FMD", [920, 922]], ["FMD", [1163, 1165]], ["Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV)", [1220, 1251]], ["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1302, 1324]], ["multifocal FMD", [1336, 1349]], ["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1513, 1535]], ["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1574, 1596]], ["Alport syndrome", [1641, 1655]], ["pheochromocytoma", [1658, 1673]], ["Marfan syndrome", [1676, 1690]], ["moyamoya disease", [1697, 1712]], ["FMD", [1830, 1832]], ["FMD", [2149, 2151]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["stenosis", [191, 198]], ["aneurysms", [202, 210]], ["dissection", [223, 232]], ["narrowing", [985, 993]], ["tears of arteries", [1007, 1023]], ["multiple aneurysms", [1403, 1420]], ["dissections) in arteries", [1436, 1459]]], "anaphor": [["this disease", [727, 738]], ["this disease", [889, 900]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Fibromuscular dysplasia", [0, 22]], ["stenosis", [191, 198]]], [["Fibromuscular dysplasia", [0, 22]], ["aneurysms", [202, 210]]], [["Fibromuscular dysplasia", [0, 22]], ["dissection", [223, 232]]], [["FMD", [920, 922]], ["narrowing", [985, 993]]], [["FMD", [920, 922]], ["tears of arteries", [1007, 1023]]], [["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1513, 1535]], ["multiple aneurysms", [1403, 1420]]], [["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1513, 1535]], ["dissections) in arteries", [1436, 1459]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["multifocal FMD", [1336, 1349]], ["fibromuscular dysplasia", [1302, 1324]]]], "is_acron": [[["FMD", [41, 43]], ["Fibromuscular dysplasia", [0, 22]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["FMD", [767, 769]], ["this disease", [727, 738]]], [["FMD", [796, 798]], ["this disease", [889, 900]]]]}}}

Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).

{"id": "Dyskeratosis-Congenita", "text": "Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT.

A diagnosis of catamenial pneumothorax is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic symptoms (i.e., repeated episodes of pneumothorax in conjunction with the onset of menses). A variety of tests may be required to rule out other conditions and to identify associated conditions such as thoracic or pelvic endometriosis or damage to the diaphragm.

Doctors must suppress the immune system to help the body accept the transplant and avoid rejection.

Immunosuppressive therapy leaves patients at a greater risk of developing infections and, in some people, of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of these disorders are extremely important. The incidence and prevalence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease varies based on the type of transplant and affects about 1%-2% of people who have received a kidney (renal) transplant.

{"id": "Moyamoya-Disease", "text": "\"Moyamoya disease is a progressive disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain (cerebrovascular). It is characterized by the narrowing (stenosis) and/or closing (occlusion) of the carotid artery inside the skull, a major artery that delivers blood to the brain. At the same time, tiny blood vessels at the base of the brain open up in an apparent attempt to supply blood to the brain distal to the blockage. These tiny vessels are the \"\"moyamoya\"\" vessels for which the disease was named. Inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya. One of the symptoms is typically stroke, which results in paralysis of the face, arms or legs, loss of speech, etc., or temporary loss of neurologic function of body parts or speech (transient ischemic attacks, or \u201cTIA\u201d). Other symptoms that may result include headaches, visual disturbances, developmental delay, and seizures. Approximately 10% of cases of moyamoya in Asian countries have a genetic cause. Patients with this arteriopathy that occurs either on a familial or idiopathic basis are said to have moyamoya disease. Patients in whom the artery changes occur in association with another process such as sickle cell disease or Down syndrome are said to have moyamoya disease. In this report, we use the term \"\"moyamoya disease\"\" as shorthand for both forms. In Japan, moyamoya disease typically occurs in females under the age of 20. In Japan, the disease is estimated to occur in 1 per 300,000 people. Although moyamoya was originally reported in individuals of Japanese ancestry, cases have been reported from elsewhere in Asia as well as from Europe, North and South America, and most series reported in the western hemisphere have a minority of patients of Asian descent.  Of note, most patients in North America are isolated cases, with recent literature suggesting that less than 4% of cases in this population are familial. (Gaillard 2017) In most patients, the diagnosis of moyamoya can be made from a careful assessment of an MRI and MRA. Cerebral arteriography will confirm the diagnosis, establish the exact degree of blood vessel narrowing, demonstrate the existing blood flow patterns to various areas of the brain, and allow treatment decisions to be made; for these reasons, it is the standard diagnostic tool for this condition. In particular, catheter angiography can help with the identification of important blood vessels called \u201ctransdural collaterals,\u201d which are present in some cases and can markedly influence surgical planning and prognosis.

{"id": "Waldenstrom_s-Macroglobulinemia", "text": "Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WMG) is a malignant disorder of the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues, a type of lymphoma and characterized by the presence of abnormally large numbers of a particular kind of white blood cell known as B lymphocytes. As these cells accumulate in the body, excessive quantities of an antibody protein known as IgM are produced. Large amounts of IgM cause the blood to become thick (hyperviscosity) and affects the flow of blood through the smaller blood vessels, leading to some of the symptoms of the disorder. Small blood vessels may tear leading to bleeding in the nose, gums, or retina. Symptoms of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia usually begin gradually. Common symptoms are fatigue and loss of energy due to anemia. Bleeding from the nose and gums may also occur, and tingling in the fingers and toes is often seen (peripheral neuropathy). Examination may also reveal enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Blurring or vision impairment may also occur due to changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina. The symptoms are quite variable depending on the effect of the thickened (viscous) blood on the organ involved. The causes of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia are unknown. There is evidence of occurrence within families, but such occurrence is uncommon. Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 3.4 million American men and about half that number of American women. The incidence of WMG is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000,000 people over the age of 50. The median age at diagnosis is 67. However, cases have been diagnosed in patients in their twenties. This disorder is considerably less common among people of African descent.

{"id": "Cholangiocarcinoma", "text": "Patients may have no symptoms, particularly when the cancer is at an early stage. Occasionally biliary tract cancers are diagnosed incidentally when a CT or MRI scan is done for another reason, or when the gallbladder is removed due to symptomatic gallstones. Patients may have non-specific symptoms including weight loss, abdominal pain, fevers, night sweats and fatigue. Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or gallbladder cancers more frequently cause patients to develop jaundice due to tumor or lymph nodes blocking a major bile duct [4]. Most cases of biliary tract cancer are sporadic, with no identifiable predisposing patient factors. There are several known risk factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma however, including liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, biliary tract stones, liver fluke infections, a congenital anatomical abnormality called a choledochal cyst and the chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts also called primary sclerosing cholangitis. Exposure to some industrial chemicals such as nitrosamines, dioxin, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls are also thought to increase an individual\u2019s risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.  In the USA, gallbladder cancer is commonly associated with the presence of long standing gallstones resulting in calcification of the gallbladder wall or \u201cporcelain gallbladder\u201d.  Gallbladder polyps are also associated with increased risk of gallbladder cancer. The incidence of bile duct cancers differs worldwide, likely reflecting both differing genetic predisposition and variable exposure to known risk factors[5]. Approximately 12,000 new affected individuals of bile duct cancers are diagnosed in the USA each year, of which over 9,000 are gallbladder cancers and distal/perihilar cholangiocarcinomas and 3,000 are intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [6]. The overall incidence of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is 1 person per 100,000 per year. The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is approximately 0.7 per 100,000. During the last 30 years, it appears that the incidence of biliary tract cancers in the United States is increasing [7]. This increase may be due in part to increased recognition of the diagnosis of biliary cancer, cases which may previously have been classified as cancer of unknown origin. Gallbladder cancer is more common in women than in men, and in some countries the rates are three times higher for women. Certain geographic areas are characterized by a high incidence of gallbladder cancer, including Chile, Bolivia and India. A high incidence also has been documented in North American Native Americans and Mexican Americans [7]. A diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer is made based on identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, clinical examination and several specialized tests including blood test, imaging tests and endoscopic procedures. Either CT or MRI scans may be used to assess the tumor size and to look for blockage of the bile ducts and sites of spread [9, 10]. ERCP may be used to insert a stent into a blocked bile duct to relieve jaundice. A biopsy is usually required to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and may be obtained by a CT or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy [11]. Some patients with gallbladder cancer are incidentally diagnosed following elective removal of their gallbladder due to gallstones, where the cancer is only detected on pathologic examination.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["cancer", [53, 58]], ["liver cirrhosis", [742, 756]], ["hepatitis B", [759, 769]], ["hepatitis B and C", [759, 775]], ["biliary tract stones", [778, 797]], ["liver fluke infections", [800, 821]], ["congenital anatomical abnormality", [826, 858]], ["cancer", [2311, 2316]], ["cancer", [3455, 3460]]], "rare_disease": [["biliary tract cancers", [95, 115]], ["Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas", [373, 412]], ["gallbladder cancers", [417, 435]], ["biliary tract cancer", [562, 581]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]], ["choledochal cyst", [869, 884]], ["chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts", [894, 933]], ["primary sclerosing cholangitis", [947, 976]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [1151, 1168]], ["gallbladder cancer", [1184, 1201]], ["gallbladder cancer", [1414, 1431]], ["bile duct cancers", [1451, 1467]], ["bile duct cancers", [1641, 1657]], ["gallbladder cancers", [1719, 1737]], ["distal/perihilar cholangiocarcinomas", [1743, 1778]], ["intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas", [1794, 1825]], ["perihilar cholangiocarcinoma", [1857, 1884]], ["intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma", [1958, 1988]], ["biliary tract cancers", [2104, 2124]], ["biliary cancer", [2244, 2257]], ["Gallbladder cancer", [2337, 2354]], ["gallbladder cancer", [2525, 2542]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [2700, 2717]], ["gallbladder cancer", [2722, 2739]], ["gallbladder cancer", [3332, 3349]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["weight loss", [310, 320]], ["abdominal pain", [323, 336]], ["night sweats", [347, 358]], ["fatigue", [364, 370]], ["jaundice", [479, 486]], ["long standing gallstones", [1247, 1270]], ["calcification of the gallbladder wall", [1285, 1321]], ["porcelain gallbladder", [1327, 1347]], ["Gallbladder polyps", [1352, 1369]], ["jaundice", [3159, 3166]], ["gallstones", [3433, 3442]]], "anaphor": [["the cancer", [3451, 3460]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["biliary tract cancers", [95, 115]], ["weight loss", [310, 320]]], [["biliary tract cancers", [95, 115]], ["abdominal pain", [323, 336]]], [["biliary tract cancers", [95, 115]], ["night sweats", [347, 358]]], [["biliary tract cancers", [95, 115]], ["fatigue", [364, 370]]], [["Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas", [373, 412]], ["jaundice", [479, 486]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [1184, 1201]], ["long standing gallstones", [1247, 1270]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [1184, 1201]], ["calcification of the gallbladder wall", [1285, 1321]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [1184, 1201]], ["porcelain gallbladder", [1327, 1347]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [1414, 1431]], ["Gallbladder polyps", [1352, 1369]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [2722, 2739]], ["jaundice", [3159, 3166]]], [["gallbladder cancer", [3332, 3349]], ["gallstones", [3433, 3442]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["liver cirrhosis", [742, 756]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]]], [["biliary tract cancer", [562, 581]], ["gallbladder cancers", [417, 435]]], [["cholangiocarcinoma", [2700, 2717]], ["gallbladder cancers", [417, 435]]], [["biliary tract stones", [778, 797]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]]], [["liver fluke infections", [800, 821]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]]], [["choledochal cyst", [869, 884]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]]], [["primary sclerosing cholangitis", [947, 976]], ["cholangiocarcinoma", [704, 721]]]], "is_a": [[["choledochal cyst", [869, 884]], ["congenital anatomical abnormality", [826, 858]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [[["Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas", [373, 412]], ["gallbladder cancers", [417, 435]]], [["chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts", [894, 933]], ["primary sclerosing cholangitis", [947, 976]]]], "anaphora": [[["gallbladder cancer", [3332, 3349]], ["the cancer", [3451, 3460]]]]}}}

{"id": "Perniosis", "text": "Perniosis is an inflammatory disorder that is triggered by prolonged exposure to cold and damp (humid) conditions. It is a form of inflammation of the small blood vessels (vasculitis) and is characterized by painful, itchy, tender, skin lesions on the lower legs, hands, toes, feet, ears and face. The lesions usually last for two to three weeks. One form of the disorder affects the blood vessels of the thighs. The exact cause of perniosis is unclear.  Cold weather causes the small veins and arteries close to the skin to tighten or constrict.  When the tissues are rewarmed, blood leaks into the tissue and causes the skin to swell.  The swelling irritates the nerves, and pain is the result.  It is thought by some that the disorder may represent an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the cold.  Prolonged exposure to the cold, insufficient protective clothing, and circulatory or cardiovascular diseases may also be causative factors.  Some cases are believed to be caused by genetic factors.  Other suspected causes include nutrition, local infection, hormonal changes, and other systemic diseases. Perniosis is seen more often in females than in males.  Also, it is seen more often in women who are very thin.  Several articles in the medical literature focus on cases of perniosis in anorexic women.

Grade IV astrocytoma occurs most often in adults between the ages of 50 and 80, is more common in men and accounts for 23% of all primary brain tumors. The diagnosis of astrocytoma is based on a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, a careful patient history, and specialized tests, such as blood tests, neuroimaging techniques, and/or other diagnostic studies. Neuroimaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain assist in evaluating tumor size, location, and other factors. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures.

{"id": "Autoimmune-Polyendocrine-Syndrome-Type-II", "text": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II, also known as Schmidt syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disorder in which there is a steep drop in production of several essential hormones by the glands that secrete these hormones. When first described, this disorder was thought to involve only adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and thyroid insufficiency (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). However, over time, as more patients were studied, the scope of the disorder was expanded to include disorders of other underperforming endocrine glands. These include the gonads, which secrete sex hormones; the pancreas which secretes insulin and is intimately tied up with diabetes mellitus; and sometimes the parathyroid glands. Failure of the endocrine glands to function is usually accompanied by signs of malnutrition because the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb nutrients is reduced dramatically.  Since the combination of affected glands differs from patient to patient, the signs of this disorder are diverse. The exact cause of AIPS-II is not known, but it is thought to result from one or more abnormal immune responses.  Autoimmune reactions occur when, for reasons not quite clear, the body mistakenly reacts to a normal antibody as if it were a foreign one. Report suggest that the prevalence of AIPS-II is about 14 to 20 cases per million of population and that it affects females 3 to 4 times as often as it does males.

Major symptoms include an underdeveloped (hypoplasia) upper jaw, downward-slanting palpebral fissures (which means that the opening between the eyelids slants downward), minor malformations of the external portion of the ears, and speech abnormalities. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A second (distinct) form of maxillofacial dysostosis is believed to be inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic diseases are determined by the combination of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes received from the father and the mother. Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. Maxillofacial dysostosis is extremely rare and the exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Approximately 12 cases have been reported in the medical literature.

{"id": "Myopathy-Congenital-Batten-Turner-Type", "text": "Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare, inherited muscle disease (myopathy) and is characterized by the lack of muscle tone or floppiness at birth (congenital hypotonia). The symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood. However, this disorder is not progressive in adulthood. The first symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy in a newborn are the slow, progressive loss of muscle tone characterized by floppiness (hypotonia) and general weakness.  Early motor skills and other important developmental milestones may be slightly delayed.  Toddlers with this disorder usually have mild muscle weakness and may be prone to falling or stumbling.  The muscles of the pelvis, neck, and shoulder area are most commonly affected.  Since the symptoms of this disease are not progressive during adulthood, most people with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy walk normally as adults.  However, some physical activities may be slightly impaired. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The symptoms of this disorder are most obvious during infancy and childhood.

{"id": "Testicular-Cancer", "text": "Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["cancer", [41, 46]], ["cancer", [135, 140]], ["testicular torsion", [396, 413]], ["epididymitis", [416, 427]], ["epididymoorchitis", [430, 446]], ["hydrocele", [449, 457]], ["varicocele", [460, 469]], ["hematoma", [472, 479]], ["spermatocele", [482, 493]], ["syphilitic gumma", [500, 515]], ["Testicular torsion", [518, 535]], ["Epididymitis", [683, 694]], ["Epididymoorchitis", [864, 880]], ["Hydrocele", [935, 943]], ["Varicocele", [1086, 1095]], ["hematoma", [1228, 1235]], ["spermatocele", [1295, 1306]], ["syphilis", [1442, 1449]]], "rare_disease": [["Testicular cancer", [0, 16]], ["testicular cancer", [223, 239]], ["testicular cancer", [360, 376]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord", [547, 599]], ["inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis)", [699, 764]], ["inflammation of the epididymis", [885, 914]], ["inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles", [885, 932]], ["fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle", [957, 1010]], ["swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle", [1023, 1083]], ["discomfort of the affected testicle", [1049, 1083]], ["enlargement of the veins within the scrotum", [1113, 1155]], ["feeling of discomfort", [1174, 1194]], ["pain", [1199, 1202]], ["impair fertility", [1208, 1223]], ["collection or small mass made up of clotted blood", [1242, 1290]], ["Syphilitic gumma", [1372, 1387]]], "anaphor": [["it", [105, 106]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Testicular torsion", [518, 535]], ["testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord", [547, 599]]], [["Epididymitis", [683, 694]], ["inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis)", [699, 764]]], [["Epididymoorchitis", [864, 880]], ["inflammation of the epididymis", [885, 914]]], [["Epididymoorchitis", [864, 880]], ["inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles", [885, 932]]], [["Hydrocele", [935, 943]], ["fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle", [957, 1010]]], [["Hydrocele", [935, 943]], ["swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle", [1023, 1083]]], [["Hydrocele", [935, 943]], ["discomfort of the affected testicle", [1049, 1083]]], [["Varicocele", [1086, 1095]], ["enlargement of the veins within the scrotum", [1113, 1155]]], [["Varicocele", [1086, 1095]], ["feeling of discomfort", [1174, 1194]]], [["Varicocele", [1086, 1095]], ["pain", [1199, 1202]]], [["Varicocele", [1086, 1095]], ["impair fertility", [1208, 1223]]], [["hematoma", [1228, 1235]], ["collection or small mass made up of clotted blood", [1242, 1290]]], [["syphilis", [1442, 1449]], ["Syphilitic gumma", [1372, 1387]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Testicular cancer", [0, 16]], ["cancer", [41, 46]]], [["it", [105, 106]], ["cancer", [135, 140]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Testicular cancer", [0, 16]], ["it", [105, 106]]]]}}}
