The severity of SLOS varies greatly in affected individuals, even in the same family, and some have normal development and only minor birth defects. SLOS is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that results in an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism.  SLOS is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. For the US the birth prevalence of SLOS has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 live births.  The predicted prevalence based on newborn screening for gene carriers is estimated to be 1 in 1,590 to 13,500 and this discrepancy may be due to the fact that many fetuses with SLOS are stillborn.   This condition occurs equally in males and females but females are often not diagnosed because genital abnormalities are missed.  SLOS occurs more often in individuals of European ancestry. The diagnosis of SLOS is based on physical findings and detection of an elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in blood serum or an elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol:cholesterol ratio.

Due to such facial abnormalities, infants with Setleis syndrome may have an aged and/or \"\"leonine\"\" (lion-like) appearance. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Most cases of Setleis syndrome are thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The majority of these cases have occurred in individuals from Puerto Rico. Setleis syndrome is usually diagnosed shortly after birth based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic features, such as distinctive scar-like, circular depressions on both temples; an aged and/or \"\"leonine\"\" facial appearance; and characteristic abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. It is possible that microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue (biopsy) from the temples may reveal abnormal thinning of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) and absence of certain specialized structures normally located within the inner layer of the skin (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles).\"", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["inherited disorder", [39,

Additional features may include other skeletal defects, genital abnormalities in affected males, or heart (cardiac) defects. Trisomy 4p is also characterized by severe mental retardation. Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Trisomy for the short arm of chromosome 4 was originally described in 1970 (Wilson MG) and delineated as a distinct clinical syndrome in 1977 (Gonzalez CH).

Although the disorder was once thought to be under control throughout the world, malaria is a widespread infection especially in the tropics where certain types of mosquitos are becoming resistant to pesticides. The annual number of cases reported in the United States has increased in recent years. Malaria is most commonly transmitted through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito which is infected by a malaria parasite (Plasmodium).  Plasmodium Falciparum, Plasmodium Ovale, Plasmodium Malariae and Plasmodium Vivax are the four species of the parasite which can affect humans.  Additionally, transfusion of blood from an infected donor, or sharing contaminated needles may transmit the infection from one person to another.  In very rare cases, the disorder has been transmitted from an infected mother to a fetus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, malaria is uncommon in the United States where approximately 1,200 cases are diagnosed each year, usually having been contracted abroad.

{"id": "Hepatic-Encephalopathy", "text": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain disorder that develops in some individuals with liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex disorder that encompasses a spectrum or continuum of disease that ranges from a subtle condition with no outward signs or symptoms to a severe form that can cause serious, life-threatening complications. Symptoms are related to progressive dysfunction of the brain and may include personality changes, intellectual impairment, impaired memory and loss of consciousness (coma). Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in individuals with acute or chronic liver (hepatic) disease or in individuals whose liver is bypassed by a portosystemic shunt (with no liver disease present). A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal passageway that allows blood from the gastrointestinal tract to bypass the liver. They can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired during life. Hepatic encephalopathy is caused when toxins that are normally cleared from the body by the liver accumulate in the blood, eventually traveling to the brain. Many of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are reversible when promptly detected and treated. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy may be suspected in some individuals with liver disease based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests that are used to rule out other conditions. Such tests may include a complete blood count, liver function tests, tests that evaluate serum ammonia levels, and an electroencephalogram, which is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain, may be useful in detecting encephalopathy.

{"id": "Tyrosine-Hydroxylase-Deficiency", "text": "Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of disease ranging from a mild movement disorder at one end to a life-threatening, neurological disorder at the other. The symptoms of the disorder can vary widely from person to another, even among members of the same family. Common symptoms include an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking (abnormal gait) and dystonia. Dystonia is a general term for a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Dystonia in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency usually affects the legs. Additional symptoms that may occur include tremors, eye abnormalities, and a tendency of affected children to walk on their tiptoes. The severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency causes symptoms at a very young age (first months of life). The symptoms generally do not resemble those of a movement disorder, but rather give the impression of a severe, diffuse brain disorder. Mild and moderate forms of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency show dramatic improvement when treated with levodopa. Levodopa is an amino acid that is converted to dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that serves as a neurotransmitter and is deficient in children with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment options for severe tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency have been less effective. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency occurs due to disruptions or changes (mutations) of the TH gene. The TH gene mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The exact incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency in the general population is unknown. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.

Infection with any of these agents (i.e., Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses) may cause a constellation of similar symptoms in affected newborns. These may include fever; difficulties feeding; small areas of bleeding under the skin, causing the appearance of small reddish or purplish spots; enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); yellowish discoloration of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice); hearing impairment; abnormalities of the eyes; and/or other symptoms and findings. Each infectious agent may also result in additional abnormalities that may be variable, depending upon a number of factors (e.g., stage of fetal development). TORCH Syndrome results from one of the TORCH agents having crossed the placenta during pregnancy.  These infectious agents include Toxoplasma gondii, the single-celled microorganism (protozoa) responsible for Toxoplasmosis; rubella virus; cytomegalovirus; and herpes simplex viruses.  (Note: According to some reports, the acronym \u201cTORCH\u201d is sometimes modified to the term \u201cSTORCH\u201d to include syphilis, a disease that may result in symptoms similar to those associated with the other TORCH agents.  Syphilis is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum.  In addition, TORCH may encompass other disease-causing agents, such as varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus responsible for chickenpox, and parvovirus.) TORCH syndrome may affect a developing fetus or newborn, potentially resulting in miscarriage, delayed fetal growth and maturation (intrauterine growth retardation), or early delivery. Treatment of newborns and infants with TORCH Syndrome is based upon the specific causative agent, the stage of fetal development when infection initially occurred, the severity of the infection and associated symptoms and findings, and/or other factors. For infants with toxoplasmosis, treatment may include administration of the medication pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine. Herpes simplex may be treated with the antiviral agent acyclovir.

{"id": "Familial-Adenomatous-Polyposis", "text": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by hundreds to thousands of precancerous colorectal polyps (adenomatous polyps). If left untreated, affected individuals inevitably develop cancer of the colon and/or rectum at a relatively young age. FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and caused by abnormalities (mutations) in the APC gene. Mutations in the APC gene cause a group of polyposis conditions that have overlapping features: familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome and attenuated FAP. Familial adenomatous polyposis affects males and females in equal numbers. It occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals in the United States and accounts for about 0.5% of all cases of colorectal cancer. One estimate suggests that familial adenomatous polyposis affects 50,000 American families. According to national registries, familial adenomatous polyposis occurs in 2.29-3.2 per 100,000 individuals. Classical FAP is diagnosed clinically when an individual has 100 or more adenomatous colorectal polyps (typically occurring by the third decade of life) or fewer than 100 polyps and a relative with FAP.

{"id": "Superior-Semicircular-Canal-Dehiscence", "text": "Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) has been defined as the absence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal facing toward the dura of the middle cranial fossa. SSCD has been implicated as the cause of a variety of inner ear symptoms including Tullio's phenomenon, pressure induced vertigo, aural fullness, autophony, conductive hearing loss, and fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, SSCD has also been reported to be asymptomatic. In the past, many patients with SSCD had been misdiagnosed as having otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tubes, middle ear perilymphatic fistulas, or M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease. Identification of this entity requires a high degree of suspicion, appropriate findings on physical exam, lab testing, and confirmation on high-resolution CT scan. Surgical repair of the SSCD or occlusion of the superior canal has been reported with a high degree of symptom resolution. SSCD has been labelled the \u201cgreat otologic mimicker\u201d because it can simulate the symptoms of so many other ear disorders. However, the most common symptoms are vertigo/dizziness elicited by pressure altering activity, Tullio\u2019s phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo), fullness/pressure in the ear and autophony.  Autophony is hearing internal noises louder than would be expected, such as hearing your eyes move/blink, heart beat or joint movements. Hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss can occur, mimicking otosclerosis or Meniere\u2019s disease. Fullness in the ear and hearing your breathing loudly in the ear are symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, but can also be found with SSCD.  Finally, most patients with the anatomic defect of superior semicircular canal dehiscence have no symptoms at all for some time prior to developing symptoms. SSCD can affect all age groups. There are no studies looking at the demographics of SSCD, however, the vast majority of patients diagnosed with SSCD are adults. Although the incidence of finding SSCD on a scan is the same for adults and children, the incidence of symptomatic SSCD in children is much less. Dehiscence of bone in other parts of the otic capsule can produce similar syndromes, although they are much less common. Other locations include the posterior semicircular canal, the horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea. Posterior semicircular canal dehiscence is often due to a high riding jugular bulb but can also been seen with anomalies of the vestibular aqueduct, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS). EVAS, by itself can also produce symptoms similar to SSCD. Horizontal semicircular canal dehiscence is most frequently the result of an eroding process such as cholesteatoma. The cochlea can have bony dehiscence where it abuts the carotid artery and at the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. Lastly, the bony opening where the hearing nerve enters the cochlea (at the internal auditory canal) can be abnormally wide, resulting in symptoms similar to SSCD. Because the condition of SSCD is still fairly new (identified in 1998), it could be argued that all treatments are considered experimental or investigational.  However, the most frequently employed are surgical. Surgery for SSCD has included resurfacing the defect with a variety of materials, plugging the superior semicircular canal, and a combination of resurfacing and plugging. These techniques can be done through a transmastoid or a middle fossa craniotomy approach. These techniques have found great success in reducing or eliminating the vestibular symptoms of SSCD. These techniques are also effective in reducing or eliminating autophony but they have not been effective in improving hearing. A lesser approach that seems to give similar benefits is reinforcement of the middle ear windows. This surgery has the advantage of being a more minimally invasive procedure but the success rate seems to be much lower with a higher recurrence rate in the long term.", "gold": {"entities":

{"id": "Stiff-Person-Syndrome", "text": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS.

{"id": "Essential-Tremor", "text": "Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive, neurological disease characterized by tremor, most often of the hands or arms. A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, movement of a body part. Tremor may be seen as involuntary shaking or trembling of the affected area. In individuals with ET, other motor symptoms may be present including an unsteady manner of walking due to an inability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia). In some cases, affected individuals may also develop a variety of non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment, depression or anxiety. ET can occur in childhood or adulthood. The exact, underlying cause of ET is not fully understood. In some cases, the disorder runs in families; in others, it occurs in individuals with no previous family history. The causes of ET are most likely many, which means that several factors, such as genetic and environmental ones, may each play a role in the development of the disorder. ET is the most prevalent tremor disorder and is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson\u2019s disease, making it difficult to determine the disorder\u2019s true frequency in the general population. An estimated 7 million Americans have ET. The incidence of ET increases with age and more than 4% of the population over the age of 40 has ET. Although the disorder is most common in older adults, it can affect individuals of any age including middle-aged or young adults and children. In rare cases, it has been reported during infancy. Individuals with a family history of ET tend to experience earlier onset of tremor. ET affects both men and women and individuals of every race or ethnicity.

{"id": "Truncus-Arteriosus", "text": "Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) in which there is a single main blood vessel, rather than the normal two, carrying blood away from the heart. Instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. Blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body. Babies with this condition may have a bluish tint (cyanosis) to their skin, lips, and fingernails. In most cases, truncus arteriosus occurs in conjunction with a missing upper portion of the wall between the ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is not known.  It has been suggested that some cases may develop due to the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).  The malformation is the result of an error in embryonic development.  Approximately 35 percent of children with this disorder also have DiGeorge syndrome, which is a severe congenital immune deficiency disorder involving the thymus and parathyroid glands.  (For more information on DiGeorge Syndrome, see the Related Disorders Section of this report.)

{"id": "Post-Polio-Syndrome", "text": "Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a syndrome that affects some people who have had polio (poliomyelitis) and occurs many years (typically from 10 to 40 years) after recovery from the initial infection. It is characterized by the development of progressive weakness in muscles that were affected by the original polio infection. In addition, those affected may experience extreme fatigue and joint pain. Skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, may occur as a result of this syndrome. There is variation in the severity of symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms may mimic those of the rare disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The degree of muscle atrophy during the post-polio period appears to reflect the severity of the impact of the initial polio infection. People who were significantly affected by polio are more likely to experience severe symptoms from post-polio syndrome. The cause of this syndrome is not known. Although exact numbers are not available, it has been estimated that there are 300,000 polio survivors in the United States and that from one-fourth to one-half of them may ultimately develop some degree of post-polio syndrome. Post-polio syndrome affects people who have had acute episodes of poliomyelitis.  It occurs 10 years or more after the original illness, and can occur as long as 40 years afterward.  According to one estimate, 25% to 50% of the 300,000 polio survivors in the United States may develop the syndrome.  At the present time, there is no known way to prevent the syndrome. Diagnosis of post-polio syndrome is made on the basis of a thorough history, a neurological examination, and the process of excluding other possible diseases through various tests.

Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye.

{"id": "Congenital-Erythropoietic-Porphyria", "text": "Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder resulting from the deficient function of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen lll cosynthase (UROS), the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Due to the impaired function of this enzyme, excessive amounts of particular porphyrins accumulate, particularly in the bone marrow, plasma, red blood cells, urine, teeth, and bones. The major symptom of this disorder is hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight and some types of artificial light, such as fluorescent lights (photosensitivity). After exposure to light, the photo-activated porphyrins in the skin cause bullae (blistering) and the fluid-filled sacs rupture, and the lesions often get infected. These infected lesions can lead to scarring, bone loss, and deformities. The hands, arms, and face are the most commonly affected areas. CEP is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Typically, there is no family history of the disease. Neither parent has symptoms of CEP, but each carries a defective gene that they can pass to their children.

{"id": "Alpers-Disease", "text": "Alpers disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that begins during childhood and is complicated in many instances by serious liver disease. Symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia). Alpers disease usually begins during early childhood, usually indicated by seizures at any age between 3 months and 5 years.  It is characterized by lack of coordination of motor movement, partial paralysis, seizures, and muscle twitching. The child is unable to achieve normal muscle tone (hypotonia), yet the limbs appear to be stiff. On MRI examination an increased density of the grey matter in the brain is noted. Usually, but not always, Alpers disease is associated with liver damage.  Mental retardation may be severe and is progressive.  The loss of intellectual functions such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning may also interfere with a person\u2019s daily functioning (dementia).   In later stages, patients may lose control of the movement of their arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). The liver may become cirrhotic and fail completely, or may not progress beyond signs of jaundice. Affected individuals may also become blind as a result of optic atrophy as the optic nerve degenerates. It is thought that Alpers disease affects males and females in equal numbers usually during early childhood.

{"id": "Kasabach", "text": "Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) is a rare condition that is associated with a coagulopathy with features including profound thrombocytopenia (low platelets), hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen), and anemia. This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.

{"id": "Schindler-disease", "text": "Schindler disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA or alpha-galactosidase B). The enzyme defect leads to the abnormal accumulation of certain complex compounds (glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides), which have terminal or preterminal N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in many tissues of the body and in urine. Two major forms of Schindler disease exist - a severe form with onset in infancy (type I) and a milder form with onset in adulthood (type II). Some researchers have proposed a type III form of Schindler disease that is less severe than type I, but more severe than type II. The specific symptoms and severity of Schindler disease can vary from one person to another. Schindler disease is caused by mutations of the NAGA gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Schindler disease affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of Schindler disease in the general population is unknown. Because cases of Schindler disease may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder\u2019s true frequency in the general population is difficult. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are infrequent, although certain disorders may occur in specific ethnic or demographic groups at higher frequencies, about one in every 1,000-2,000 live births for Gaucher and Fabry diseases, or very infrequently (1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births) for most of these disorders, which may be the case for alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency.

{"id": "Arthritis-Infectious", "text": "Infectious arthritis is an inflammation of one or more joints that occurs as a result of infection by bacteria, viruses or, less frequently, fungi or parasites. The symptoms of Infectious arthritis depend upon which agent has caused the infection but symptoms often include fever, chills, general weakness, and headaches, followed by inflammation and painful swelling of one or more joints of the body. Any disease-causing microbe may infect a joint.  Bacteria are most often responsible, typically producing an acute arthritic attack.  In young children the most common bacteria are staphylococci, haemophilus influenzae, and gram- negative bacilli.  Older children and adults are most commonly infected with gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci or pneumococci.  Acute infectious arthritis at any age may be associated with rubella, mumps or hepatitis B infections.  Fungi and fungi-like bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc may cause chronic infectious arthritis.  People with rheumatoid arthritis and chronically inflamed joints are particularly susceptible to infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis can affect people of all ages and both sexes.  About half of all cases involve adults over the age of 60.  The incidence is reported as 2-10 cases per 100,000 of general population.  For patients with immunologic disorders, the incidence increases to about 30-70 cases per 100,000 people.  In gonococcal arthritis, the disorder is found in three times as many women as men.

{"id": "Blue-Rubber-Bleb-Nevus-syndrome", "text": "Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder that affects the skin and internal organs of the body. Multiple distinctive skin lesions are usually characteristic of this disorder and are often present at birth or present during early childhood. Lesions in the gastrointestinal tract frequently become apparent during childhood or early adulthood. The lesions are multifocal venous malformations, resulting from abnormal embryonic blood vessel development. BRBNS is characterized by soft, elevated lesions on the skin or just under the skin that are dark blue, red, purple-red or black in color. The venous malformations may be tender, contain blood and be easily compressed and are usually located on the upper limbs, trunk and soles of the feet but can occur anywhere. The lesions increase in size and become more apparent over time but have not been reported to become cancerous. The organ system most commonly affected by BRBNS is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly the small intestine. The lesions in the GI tract often bleed and can lead to mild or severe anemia. Iron replacement and/or frequent blood transfusions may be required. The GI lesions can also cause an obstruction or blockage (intussusception) of part of the bowel. Skeletal abnormalities and venous malformations in muscle are sometimes associated with BRBNS. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is sporadic.  Although families have been described in which the condition follows autosomal dominant inheritance, these families actually have other multifocal venous malformations.

{"id": "Tongue-Hairy", "text": "Hairy tongue is an uncommon, benign condition that is also known as black hairy tongue or lingua nigra. It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or \"staining\" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue's surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue's surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal \u201cshedding\u201d (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician's direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["inherited disease", [1623, 1639]]], "rare_disease": [["Hairy tongue", [0, 11]], ["black hairy tongue", [68, 85]], ["lingua nigra", [90, 101]], ["Hairy tongue", [493, 504]], ["hairy tongue", [964, 975]], ["Hairy tongue", [1367, 1378]], ["oral cancer", [1418, 1428]], ["hairy tongue", [1456, 1467]], ["Hairy tongue", [1501, 1512]], ["hairy tongue", [1898, 1909]], ["hairy tongue", [2067, 2078]], ["hairy tongue", [2241, 2252]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or \"staining\" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae)", [136, 253]], ["blackish or dark brownish discoloration or \"staining\" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae)", [151, 253]], ["desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae", [566, 626]], ["overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth", [629, 715]], ["abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region", [725, 805]]], "anaphor": [["It", [104, 105]], ["it", [1407, 1408]], ["it", [1553, 1554]], ["It", [1610, 1611]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["It", [104, 105]], ["elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or \"staining\" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae)", [136, 253]]], [["It", [104, 105]], ["blackish or dark brownish discoloration or \"staining\" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae)", [151, 253]]], [["Hairy tongue", [493, 504]], ["desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae", [566, 626]]], [["Hairy tongue", [493, 504]], ["overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth", [629, 715]]], [["Hairy tongue", [493, 504]], ["abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region", [725, 805]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [[["black hairy tongue", [68, 85]], ["Hairy tongue", [0, 11]]], [["lingua nigra", [90, 101]], ["black hairy tongue", [68, 85]]]], "anaphora": [[["Hairy tongue", [0, 11]], ["It", [104, 105]]], [["Hairy tongue", [1367, 1378]], ["it", [1407, 1408]]], [["Hairy tongue", [1501, 1512]], ["it", [1553, 1554]]], [["Hairy tongue", [1501, 1512]], ["It", [1610, 1611]]]]}}}

{"id": "Anemia-of-Chronic-Disease", "text": "Anemia of chronic disease, also called the anemia of inflammation, is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Anemia is characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. Anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. In mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness. The underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood. Anemia of chronic disease varies in severity from one person to another. In most cases, anemia is usually mild or moderate. Affected individuals may develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, irritability, chest pain and additional findings. These symptoms may occur in any individual who has a comparable degree of anemia. In most cases, the symptoms associated with the underlying disease usually take precedent over the mild or moderate anemia symptoms. In rare cases, anemia of chronic disease can be severe and cause more serious complications. Anemia of chronic disease affects males and females in equal proportion. Individuals of any age who have a chronic, inflammatory condition can potentially develop the condition. The exact incidence of anemia of chronic disease is unknown and some researchers believe that it is underreported or often goes unrecognized. Anemia of chronic disease is believed to be the second most common cause of anemia in the United States after iron-deficiency anemia. A diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests can measure the levels of certain substances in the body including hemoglobin levels, the levels of iron in the serum, total iron binding capacity, overall red blood cell count, or normal or increased levels of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body\u2019s iron stores in the blood plasma. Another test that may be performed measures transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a protein that is involved in the transport of iron from the intestines into the bloodstream.

{"id": "Keratosis-Seborrheic", "text": "Seborrheic Keratosis is a skin disorder usually characterized by discolored lesions that appear to be \"stuck on\" the skin surface. Warts may appear and skin is often oily or greasy. These skin lesions are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths and tend to appear predominately during middle age. Itching, irritation, inflammations or unsightliness of lesions may require surgical removal of affected skin areas. Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratosis are limited to discolored skin lesions that appear to be \u201cstuck on\u201d the skin surface.  These patches may appear suddenly, may vary in size, and tend to grow slowly.  They may be round or oval-shaped, and vary in color from tan, yellowish-brown to black.  They may be widespread over the trunk, back, and/or shoulders.  Some may be large enough to be called \u201cgiants\u201d while others may be limited to small areas of the temples or cheeks.  The skin lesions may also be waxy, scaling or crusted.  They tend to become darker and larger with age. The exact cause of Seborrheic Keratosis is not known although researchers believe some forms may be inherited as a dominant trait.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed \u201cdominating\u201d the normal gene and resulting in appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.) Seborrheic Keratosis predominately affects middle aged individuals, although in very rare cases, it can be present at birth. Since Seborrheic Keratosis is not a form of skin cancer, treatment is not essential and removal of lesions is usually performed only to enhance comfort and/or cosmetic appearance. Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis consists of removal of the skin lesions by scraping (curettage), sealing off blood vessels or destruction of lesions (electrodessication) with local anesthetic, shave excision, or freezing with CO2 snow or liquid nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid may be used to eliminate lesions. Dermabrasion removal may also be performed.

{"id": "Acquired-Lipodystrophy", "text": "Acquired lipodystrophy is a general term for types of lipodystrophy that are not inherited, but rather acquired at some point during life. Acquired lipodystrophies do not have a direct genetic cause, but rather many different factors may be involved. Acquired lipodystrophies can be caused by medications, autoimmunity or for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Subtypes of acquired lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and high active antiretroviral induced lipodystrophy, which may develop in HIV-infected individuals undergoing a specific form of treatment. Onset of acquired forms of lipodystrophy can occur during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals develop characteristic loss of body fat (adipose tissue) affecting specific areas of the body, especially the arms, legs, face, neck, and chest or thoracic regions. In some cases, metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance can develop. Such complications include an inability to break down glucose (glucose intolerance), elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), and diabetes. Additional symptoms such as fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver or hepatic steatosis) may also occur. AGL and APL generally affect women more than men, although this may be due in part to ascertainment bias because women tend to be more severely affected and more easily recognized. APL has been reported in approximately 250 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:4. It has been reported in individuals of various different ethnicities. AGL has been reported in approximately 100 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:3. Most cases have been reported in Caucasians.

Associated symptoms and findings typically include delays in physical development before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation); characteristic abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance; malformations of the hands and arms (upper limbs); and mild to severe intellectual disability. Many infants and children with the disorder have an unusually small, short head (microbrachycephaly); a prominent vertical groove between the upper lip and nose (philtrum); a depressed nasal bridge; upturned nostrils (anteverted nares); and a protruding upper jaw (maxillary prognathism) with small chin (micrognathia). Additional characteristic facial abnormalities may include thin, downturned lips; low-set ears; arched, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys); an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and curly, unusually long eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have distinctive malformations of the limbs, such as unusually small hands and feet, inward deviation (clinodactyly) of the fifth fingers, and webbing (syndactyly) of certain toes. Less commonly, there may be absence of the forearms, hands, and fingers. Infants with CdLS may also have feeding and breathing difficulties; an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; a low-pitched \"growling\" cry and low voice; heart defects; delayed skeletal maturation; hearing loss; or other physical abnormalities. The range and severity of associated symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from person to person. CdLS is a very rare disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital).

{"id": "Retinitis-Pigmentosa", "text": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) comprises a large group of inherited vision disorders that cause progressive degeneration of the retina, the light sensitive membrane that coats the inside of the eyes. Peripheral (or side) vision gradually decreases and eventually is lost in most cases. Central vision is usually preserved until late in these conditions. Some forms of RP can be associated with deafness, obesity, kidney disease, and various other general health problems, including central nervous system and metabolic disorders, and occasionally chromosomal abnormalities. RP as a group of vision disorders affects about 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 people in the world. This means that, with a population of about 324 million in the United States in mid-July 2017 (see < http://www.census.gov/> for continuous updates), about 81,000 to 108,000 people in the United States have RP or a related disorder. With a worldwide population presently estimated at over 7.05 billion, it can be estimated that approximately 1.77 to 2.35 million people around the world have one of these disorders. Excluding age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, the genetic causes of which are complex and linked simultaneously to more than one gene (so called \u201cpolygenic\u201d disorders), RP is the most common cause of inherited visual loss. RP is diagnosed by electroretinography (ERG) showing progressive loss in photoreceptor function, visual field testing, and retinal imaging [mainly by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF) that show detailed microanatomical features that cannot be resolved by naked eye].

{"id": "Arthrogryposis-Multiplex-Congenita", "text": "Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["Arthrogryposis", [0, 13]], ["arthrogryposis", [453, 466]], ["isolated congenital contracture", [482, 512]], ["isolated congenital contracture", [542, 572]], ["clubfoot", [577, 584]], ["arthrogryposis", [592, 605]], ["Arthrogryposis", [766, 779]], ["Isolated congenital contractures", [1015, 1046]], ["neuropathic or myopathic disorders", [1567, 1600]], ["myopathic disorders", [1582, 1600]], ["arthrogryposis", [2254, 2267]]], "rare_disease": [["arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", [681, 714]], ["AMC", [717, 719]], ["AMC", [747, 749]], ["amyoplasia", [754, 763]], ["arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", [785, 818]], ["AMC", [900, 902]], ["AMC", [1117, 1119]], ["AMC", [1167, 1169]], ["AMC", [1236, 1238]], ["AMC", [1475, 1477]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally)", [56, 167]], ["contracture", [172, 182]], ["joint becomes permanently fixed", [210, 240]], ["congenital contractures occur only in one body are", [375, 424]], ["arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas", [592, 641]], ["multiple congenital contractures", [1308, 1339]]], "anaphor": [["The condition", [928, 940]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Arthrogryposis", [0, 13]], ["development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally)", [56, 167]]], [["Arthrogryposis", [0, 13]], ["contracture", [172, 182]]], [["Arthrogryposis", [0, 13]], ["joint becomes permanently fixed", [210, 240]]], [["isolated congenital contracture", [482, 512]], ["congenital contractures occur only in one body are", [375, 424]]], [["arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", [681, 714]], ["arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas", [592, 641]]], [["AMC", [1236, 1238]], ["multiple congenital contractures", [1308, 1339]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["clubfoot", [577, 584]], ["isolated congenital contracture", [542, 572]]], [["AMC", [747, 749]], ["amyoplasia", [754, 763]]]], "is_acron": [[["AMC", [717, 719]], ["arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", [681, 714]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["AMC", [900, 902]], ["The condition", [928, 940]]]]}}}

{"id": "Precocious-Puberty", "text": "Precocious puberty means an abnormally early onset of puberty. A sequence of events occurs during which a child develops into a young adult beginning at an unexpectedly early age. Glands that secrete growth and sex hormones begin to function abnormally early in life resulting in this condition. Often, the exact cause of precocious puberty is not known. Normal puberty begins with hypothalamic production of kisspeptin, which stimulates the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in the frequency and magnitude of gonadotropin release, especially LH. Unfortunately, it is challenging to determine the initial clinical corollary to these biochemical events. It has been suggested that there is a continuum of sexual development in girls from uncomplicated premature thelarche to true precocious puberty; the former being more likely to develop in girls under 2 years of age. This spectrum exists both clinically and biochemically and emphasizes the need for the clinician to distinguish between these conditions in patients when making decisions about treatment. The criteria for diagnosis and treatment of CPP need to be reached through a synthesis of clinical findings as well as laboratory evidence for activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The gold standard for determination of pubertal gonadotropin secretion is the GnRH stimulation test, though many clinicians start with a sensitive measurement of serum LH. Skeletal age determination is frequently obtained early in the work-up, and can be helpful in distinguishing isolated signs of puberty, which do not typically cause advancement in bone age as compared to true PP, which will advance bone maturity. In boys, serum DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OH progesterone and \u03b2-HCG levels are useful for the diagnosis of GIPP. In girls, serum DHEAS, estradiol and 17-OH progesterone levels are useful. Diagnostic studies including head MRI and pelvic ultrasound are frequently required in the work-up of children with PP.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [], "rare_disease": [["Precocious puberty", [0, 17]], ["precocious puberty", [322, 339]], ["premature thelarche", [794, 812]], ["precocious puberty", [822, 839]], ["CPP", [1145, 1147]], ["PP", [1680, 1681]], ["GIPP", [1822, 1825]], ["PP", [2019, 2020]]], "symptom_and_sign": [], "anaphor": [["this condition", [280, 293]], ["these conditions", [1033, 1048]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Precocious puberty", [0, 17]], ["this condition", [280, 293]]], [["premature thelarche", [794, 812]], ["these conditions", [1033, 1048]]], [["precocious puberty", [822, 839]], ["these conditions", [1033, 1048]]]]}}}
{"id": "Bronchiolitis-Obliterans-Organizing-Pneumonia", "text": "Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare inflammatory lung disorder which was first described in the 1980\u2019s as a unique disease entity composed of clinical symptoms such as flu-like illness in many individuals as well as cough and shortness of breath with exertional activities. Wheezing and hemoptysis are rare. The term bronchiolitis obliterans refers to swirls or plugs of fibrous, granulation tissue filling the small bronchiole airways. Organizing pneumonia refers to organized swirls of inflammatory tissue filling the small spherical units of the lungs referred to as alveoli and the alveolar ducts. Individuals with BOOP experience inflammation of the bronchioles and alveolar lung spherical units simultaneously, which distinguishes it from other similar inflammatory lung disorders. Though the term pneumonia is used, BOOP is not an infection. In most cases, the cause of BOOP is unknown and is referred to as idiopathic BOOP. Causes of BOOP include radiation therapy; exposure to certain fumes or chemicals, exposure to birds, post respiratory infections, after organ transplantation; and from more than 35 medications. Systemic disorders associated with BOOP include the connective-tissue diseases, immunological disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. BOOP has also been seen in association with lung abscess, lung cancer, and lymphoma. Importantly, the BOOP lesion is seen in individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and in these situations, the primary lung disease is the IPF and the secondary process is BOOP. BOOP affects males and females in equal numbers. It develops in individuals between 40-60 years old, but the disorder may affect individuals of any age. BOOP is estimated to account for 5 to 10% of the chronic infiltrative lung disease in the United States. BOOP has been reported throughout the world. A diagnosis of BOOP may be made based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as x-ray studies, especially a high-resolution chest computed tomography or HRCT, pulmonary function studies that includes a diffusing capacity test, and often a lung biopsy for microscopic tissue analysis. Lung biopsy may be via conventional transbronchial biopsy which frequently captures the diagnosis, transbronchial cryobiopsy which is newer and recovers a larger bit of tissue or in selected cases, open lung biopsy.

{"id": "Carnitine-Palmitoyltransferase-1A-Deficiency", "text": "Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency (CPT1A) is characterized by a sudden onset of liver failure and damage to the nervous system resulting from liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy), usually associated with fasting or illness. CPT1A deficiency is caused by an abnormality (mutation) in the CPT1A gene that results in the production of an abnormally functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 enzyme and decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. CPT1A deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Three types of CPT1A deficiency have been recognized:  The hepatic encephalopathy type usually occurs in children and is associated with a low level of ketones in the blood, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), enlarged liver, muscle weakness and elevated carnitine in the blood.  The adult-onset myopathy type is characterized by a sudden onset of muscle cramping associated with exercise without low blood sugar or liver dysfunction.  The third type is acute fatty liver of pregnancy that occurs when a pregnant woman with one abnormal CPT1A gene carries a fetus with two abnormal CPT1A genes and is associated with liver failure in the mother. CPT1A deficiency has been reported in approximately 30-40 individuals.   The incidence of this condition may be higher in the Hutterite populations in the northern United States and Canada and the Inuit populations in northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland.  This condition occurs with equal frequency in males and females. CPT1A deficiency is diagnosed by a combination of physical symptoms and laboratory testing. The typical laboratory findings include low levels of ketones, elevated liver transaminases, elevated ammonia and elevated total serum carnitine.

Hearing loss typically affects both ears (bilateral). Individuals with this disorder usually have dry, fragile, lusterless, and/or coarse scalp hair as well as areas of patchy hair loss (alopecia). Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been reported in the medical literature. Bj\u00f6rnstad syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that was first described in 1965. In theory, it affects males and females in equal numbers. However, in observed cases, more females than males have been identified. More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of Bj\u00f6rnstad Syndrome may be suspected by the finding of twisted hair (i.e., pili torti), which may be obvious at birth.

{"id": "Empty-Sella-Syndrome", "text": "Empty sella syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by enlargement or malformation of a structure in the skull known as the sella turcica. The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression located in the bone at the base of skull (sphenoid bone), in which resides the pituitary gland. In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid and a very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella (partially empty sella) or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland (completely empty sella). Most individuals with empty sella syndrome do not have any associated symptoms, but the finding raises concerns about hormone deficiencies. Empty sella syndrome may occur as a primary disorder, for which the cause is unknown (idiopathic), or as a secondary disorder, in which it occurs due to an underlying condition or disorder such as a treated pituitary tumor, head trauma, or a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also called pseudotumor cerebri) during which elevated intracranial pressure causes empty sella syndrome. Primary empty sella syndrome affects approximately 4 times more women than men. Most cases occur in middle-aged women who are obese and have high blood pressure (hypertension). Because most people with empty sella syndrome do not have symptoms and may go undiagnosed, determining the disorder\u2019s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Some researchers have estimated that less than 1 percent of individuals with empty sella syndrome ultimately develop symptoms associated with the disorder, although this may be higher in men compared to women. A diagnosis of empty sella syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized imaging techniques. Imaging may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures.

{"id": "Dupuytren_s-Contracture", "text": "Dupuytren's contracture is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by fixation of the joints (e.g., proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) of certain fingers in a permanently flexed position (joint contractures). Due to abnormal thickening and shortening of the bands of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the palm (palmar fascia), a hardened nodule may develop, eventually forming an abnormal band of hardened (fibrotic) tissue. As a result, the fingers of the affected area begin to be drawn in toward the palm over several months or years and cannot be pulled back (contracture). In addition, the skin of the affected area may pucker. In most cases, the ring and pinky (fourth and fifth) fingers are most affected. In addition, the disorder usually affects both hands (bilateral). Although the exact cause of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, risk for the disorder appears to be increased by alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis) and the presence or certain other diseases, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. In addition, it is thought that genetic predisposition may be a factor. Dupuytren\u2019s contracture is characterized by a drawing up of the fingers toward the palms of the hand.  The feet are rarely involved.  Loss of function of the fingers and deformities may also occur, including nodular growths on the fingers.  One or both hands may be affected.  The right hand seems to be more frequently involved when involvement is only one sided (unilateral).  The ring finger is involved most often, followed in order by the little, middle and index fingers.  A nodule or plaque may develop as the first symptom on the finger.  Symptoms may develop spontaneously and without any known associated condition.

Patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. Jejunal Atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  Human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the  same for each pregnancy.

{"id": "Sudden-Infant-Death-Syndrome", "text": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under the age of 1 year that remains unexplained after careful review of the history, death scene investigation, and thorough autopsy. In 2008, the most recent published data from the National Vital Statistics System indicated that SIDS was listed as the third leading cause of death in infants in the United States. Causes of SIDS are considered to be multifactorial. The triple risk hypothesis describes the presence of three risk factors that, when overlapping, predispose a baby to SIDS. These include an environmental trigger/stress, a critical developmental period, and an underlying vulnerability. Physician-scientists and scientists are studying neuropathological tissue and genetic material from SIDS victims to ascertain factors that might be responsible for heightening an infant\u2019s vulnerability to SIDS. Others are performing physiologic studies on infants known to have an increased risk for SIDS. Basic scientists are studying animal models that might provide insight into mechanisms responsible for SIDS. Current clinical management targets improving education for families and caregivers regarding known modifiable environmental stressors (risk factors) (see below). There are typically no symptoms prior to a SIDS death. Though SIDS occurs during sleep, the deaths may occur during day or night time sleep. Existing literature does not indicate any evidence for suffering by the infant in the moments preceding the sudden death. SIDS can affect all infants under 1 year of age. Most deaths occur less than 6 months of age with the peak affected age between 2 and 4 months. Gender, ethnic and racial differences also exist. For example, boys are at greater risk for SIDS than girls. Also, the SIDS rate in African American infants is 2.7 times greater than the Caucasian rate in the US. Likewise, SIDS rates are increased in the American Indians and Alaskan natives as compared to Caucasians. These differences may reflect both cultural practices and genetic variations.

These plaques tend to develop most often on the skin of the extremities.  They usually disappear during the summer.  A progressive neurologic syndrome develops during adulthood, consisting of impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), imperfect articulation of speech (dysarthria), involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes (nystagmus), and decreased tendon reflexes. Erythrokeratodermia with ataxia is an extremely rare disorder that is thought to affect males and females in equal numbers. The diagnosis of erythrokeratodermia with ataxia may be suspected soon after birth by the appearance of characteristic skin lesions.

{"id": "Polycystic-Liver-Disease", "text": "Polycystic liver disease is characterized by the growth of more than 10 cysts in the liver, ranging in size from a few millimeters to over 15 cm in diameter. Symptoms usually begin to show in people around 50 years old, as cysts grow in size and number with age [1]. Some people begin to have symptoms in early adulthood and many affected individuals do not have symptoms. The growth and accumulation of cysts can cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and compression of adjacent anatomical structures, leading to abdominal pain and discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), indigestion (dyspepsia), gastro-esophageal reflux, and limited mobility [3-6]. More rarely, liver cysts can also compress the bile duct and lead to yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Compression of the blood vessels of the liver by cysts can lead to accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), bleeding, and high blood pressure in the blood flow from intestines to the liver (portal hypertension) [12-14].  In rare cases, patients can suffer from cyst bleeding (hepatic cyst hemorrhage), or a cyst can be infected by bacteria (hepatic cyst infection), causing pain and fever. Infrequently, large liver cysts may rupture, causing severe abdominal pain. (Van Aerts et al. 2017) Even with the presence of many cysts, the liver of individuals with polycystic liver disease functions normally. Polycystic liver disease affects around one in 100,000 people [1, 2]. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, but most patients with symptoms and with severe disease are women. The suggested cause of this difference is that female sex hormones, such as estrogen, contribute to growth of liver cysts  [1, 3, 7, 13, 17, 22]. Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy are also associated with more severe disease [23-25]. Cysts can begin to grow at any age, but are rare in childhood and more common with age.

{"id": "Anemia-Hemolytic-Cold-Antibody", "text": "Cold antibody hemolytic anemia (CAHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (rbcs) by the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (antibodies). Normally, the red blood cells have a life span of approximately 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen. In individuals with CAHA, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. The severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production. Although cold antibody hemolytic anemia is known to be an autoimmune disorder, neither its exact underlying cause nor the process by which the disorder becomes apparent is fully understood.  Autoimmune disorders occur when the body\u2019s natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects older people.  The incidence of CAHA in the general population is about 1 in 80,000.  There appears to be a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of CAHA, with a male to female ratio of 2 to 3.  Those individuals with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this disorder. In order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from the other anemias, doctors examine the patient's blood to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells, since the number of young cells is increased in hemolytic anemia.

Symptoms associated with Budd Chiari syndrome include pain in the upper right part of the abdomen, an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly), and/or accumulation of fluid in the space (peritoneal cavity) between the two layers of the membrane that lines the stomach (ascites). Additional findings that may be associated with the disorder include nausea, vomiting, and/or an abnormally large spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of the disorder varies from case to case, depending upon the site and number of affected veins. In some cases, if the major hepatic veins are involved, high blood pressure in the veins carrying blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract back to the heart through the liver (portal hypertension) may be present. In most cases, the exact cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome is unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Most cases tend to affect individuals between the ages of twenty and forty. A diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. A procedure in which a radiographic dye is administered into the body to allow for x-rays of the blood vessels (angiography) is often used to aid diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) and ultrasound are also used as diagnostic procedures.

It is an infectious disorder contracted chiefly by laboratory workers exposed to infected monkeys and/or simian tissue cultures. It is characterized by a viral invasion of the brain (Encephalitis) and the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain. Occasionally, the infection affects the spinal cord structures as well (Encephalomyelitis). Neurological damage may result from this infection. Without treatment, some cases of Simian B Virus may be life- threatening. Simian B Virus Infection is characterized by fever, headache, vomiting, discomfort (malaise), and a stiff neck and back.  These symptoms may be associated with neuromuscular dysfunction, respiratory difficulties, vision problems, cranial nerve abnormalities, alteration of consciousness, personality changes, seizures and/or partial paralysis (paresis).  Some patients may go into a coma.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["infectious disorder", [70, 88]]], "rare_disease": [["Simian B Virus Infection", [0, 23]], ["Encephalitis", [244, 255]], ["Encephalomyelitis", [382, 398]], ["Simian B Virus", [487, 500]], ["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["viral invasion of the brain (Encephalitis) and the membranes (meninges)", [215, 285]], ["Encephalitis", [244, 255]], ["Encephalomyelitis", [382, 398]], ["Neurological damage", [402, 420]], ["fever", [573, 577]], ["headache", [580, 587]], ["vomiting", [590, 597]], ["malaise", [612, 618]], ["stiff neck", [628, 637]], ["stiff neck and back", [628, 646]], ["neuromuscular dysfunction", [688, 712]], ["respiratory difficulties", [715, 738]], ["vision problems", [741, 755]], ["cranial nerve abnormalities", [758, 784]], ["alteration of consciousness", [787, 813]], ["personality changes", [816, 834]], ["seizures", [837, 844]], ["paresis", [872, 878]], ["coma", [911, 914]]], "anaphor": [["It", [61, 62]], ["It", [190, 191]], ["the infection", [324, 336]], ["this infection", [438, 451]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["It", [190, 191]], ["viral invasion of the brain (Encephalitis) and the membranes (meninges)", [215, 285]]], [["It", [190, 191]], ["Encephalitis", [244, 255]]], [["the infection", [324, 336]], ["Encephalomyelitis", [382, 398]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["fever", [573, 577]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["headache", [580, 587]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["vomiting", [590, 597]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["malaise", [612, 618]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["stiff neck", [628, 637]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["stiff neck and back", [628, 646]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["neuromuscular dysfunction", [688, 712]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["respiratory difficulties", [715, 738]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["vision problems", [741, 755]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["cranial nerve abnormalities", [758, 784]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["alteration of consciousness", [787, 813]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["personality changes", [816, 834]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["seizures", [837, 844]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["paresis", [872, 878]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [528, 551]], ["coma", [911, 914]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["It", [61, 62]], ["infectious disorder", [70, 88]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Simian B Virus Infection", [0, 23]], ["It", [61, 62]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [0, 23]], ["It", [190, 191]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [0, 23]], ["the infection", [324, 336]]], [["Simian B Virus Infection", [0, 23]], ["this infection", [438, 451]]]]}}}
