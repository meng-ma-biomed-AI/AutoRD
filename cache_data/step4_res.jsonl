The range and severity of symptoms varies, greatly depending on the exact location and size of the missing genetic material. Symptoms commonly associated with partial monosomy 11q include abnormally slow growth before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal physical growth retardation), moderate to severe delay in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and muscular activity and intellectual disability. Rarely, individuals may have normal/borderline intelligence while most children have mild to severe intellectual disability. Characteristic physical abnormalities may include dimorphism (unusual shape) of the head and face (craniofacial), hands, feet, congenital defects of the ear, bleeding due to platelet abnormalities, and immunological defects. The exact cause of partial monosomy 11q is not fully understood. Partial monosomy 11q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that is apparent at birth. The disorder was initially described in the medical literature in 1973. Since that time, more than 200 cases have been described in the medical literature.

{"id": "Endocardial-Fibroelastosis", "text": "Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder that affects infants and children. It is characterized by a thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue (inelastic collagen) and elastic fibers. The normal heart has four chambers. Two chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum. The other two chambers, known as ventricles, are also separated by a septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Fewer than 1 percent of infants and children with congenital heart disease are diagnosed with this disorder.  A 1964 study suggested an incidence of 1 in 5,000 live births.  However, in the United States there has been a marked reduction in incidence since then for reasons that are not known.  The disorder is extremely rare. The diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis is confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a physical examination that may reveal signs of respiratory distress (i.e., moist rales) and galloping heart rhythms. Radiographic studies (x-ray) of the chest typically reveal abnormal enlargement of the heart, especially the left ventricle (ventricular hypertrophy). Damage to the heart may be demonstrated by measuring the electrical activity of the heart (i.e., electrocardiogram [EKG]). This test may show subtle changes (i.e., S-T segment and T-wave changes) that strongly suggest damage to the heart that is characteristic of EFE. Repeated electrocardiograms may be required to monitor changes in heart function.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["heart disorder", [43, 56]], ["congenital heart disease", [718, 741]]], "rare_disease": [["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [0, 25]], ["EFE", [28, 30]], ["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [572, 597]], ["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["EFE", [1630, 1632]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers", [118, 176]], ["increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue (inelastic collagen) and elastic fibers", [188, 281]], ["respiratory distress", [1145, 1164]], ["moist rales", [1173, 1183]], ["galloping heart rhythms", [1190, 1212]], ["enlargement of the heart", [1283, 1306]], ["ventricular hypertrophy", [1340, 1362]], ["damage to the heart", [1584, 1602]]], "anaphor": [["this disorder", [762, 774]], ["The disorder", [963, 974]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [0, 25]], ["thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers", [118, 176]]], [["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [0, 25]], ["increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue (inelastic collagen) and elastic fibers", [188, 281]]], [["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["respiratory distress", [1145, 1164]]], [["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["moist rales", [1173, 1183]]], [["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["galloping heart rhythms", [1190, 1212]]], [["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["enlargement of the heart", [1283, 1306]]], [["endocardial fibroelastosis", [1012, 1037]], ["ventricular hypertrophy", [1340, 1362]]], [["EFE", [1630, 1632]], ["damage to the heart", [1584, 1602]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [572, 597]], ["this disorder", [762, 774]]]], "is_a": [[["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [0, 25]], ["heart disorder", [43, 56]]]], "is_acron": [[["EFE", [28, 30]], ["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [0, 25]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Endocardial fibroelastosis", [572, 597]], ["The disorder", [963, 974]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["heart disorder", "A disease involving the heart and/or pericardium."], ["heart disease", "A disease involving the heart and/or pericardium."], ["congenital heart disease", "A heart disease that is present at birth.

{"id": "Charcot", "text": "Symptoms of CMT disease usually begin gradually in adolescence, but can begin earlier or later. In almost all cases, the longest nerve fibers are affected first. Over time, affected individuals may lose the normal use of their feet, hands, legs and arms. Common red flags can include decreased sensitivity to heat, touch or pain, muscle weakness in the hand, foot or lower leg, trouble with fine motor skills, high-stepped gait (foot drop), loss of muscle mass in the lower leg, frequent tripping or falling, hammertoe, high foot arch and flat feet. Stretch reflexes may be lost. The disease is slowly progressive and variable and those affected may remain active for years and live a normal life span. In the most severe cases, breathing difficulties can hasten death. Symptoms of CMT hereditary neuropathy usually begin gradually sometime in adolescence, early adulthood or middle age. The condition affects an equal number of males and females. CMT hereditary neuropathy is the most common inherited neurological disorder affecting more than 250,000 Americans. Since this condition is frequently undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or diagnosed very late in life, the true number of affected persons may be higher. The diagnosis of CMT hereditary neuropathy can be challenging. The diagnosis is based on physical symptoms, family history and clinical tests. Clinical tests include nerve conduction velocity (NCV) which measures the speed at which impulses travel along the nerves and electromyogram (EMG) which records the electrical activity of muscle cell. .

These mutations are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Juvenile hemochromatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is rare, but the actual incidence in the general population is unknown. Juvenile hemochromatosis has been reported worldwide.

{"id": "Wieacker-Syndrome", "text": "Symptoms of Wieacker syndrome include stiffening of the muscles and joints of the feet (contracture), slowly progressive atrophy of certain muscles of the legs and arms, and mild intellectual disability. Other symptoms are impairment or inability to move the eyes despite the wish to do so, and impairment in the use of face and tongue muscles. In some cases, affected individuals may have droopy eyelids (ptosis), crossed eyes (strabismus), and farsightedness (hyperopia). Abnormal curvature of the spine may also occur (kyphoscoliosis). The prevalence of Wieacker syndrome is not known. Wieacker syndrome usually affects males, but some carrier females show mild manifestations of the disorder. As of 2015, the syndrome has been reported in 5 families. ZC4H2 gene mutations have also been identified in 3 sporadic patients who presented more or less severe intellectual disability and congenital contractures of multiple joints, at least equinovarus of the feet, associated with neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, spasticity, seizures and ptosis.

{"id": "Lambert", "text": "LEMS is characterized by weakness and fatigue especially of the muscles in the legs and arms. The disease may affect the patient\u2019s ability to engage in strenuous exercise and may make such activities as climbing stairs or walking up a steep walkway difficult. Onset is gradual, typically taking place over several weeks to many months. There is often a progression of symptoms whereby the shoulder muscles, muscles of the feet & hands, speech & swallowing muscles and eye muscles are affected in a stepwise fashion. The symptoms progress more quickly when LEMS is associated with cancer. Most LEMS patients also exhibit the following symptoms (sometimes called autonomic symptoms): dry mouth, dry eyes, constipation, impotence, and decreased sweating. LEMS patients with or without cancer may also undergo significant weight loss. The tendon reflexes are diminished or absent on examination. Hence, in summary, LEMS is often described as a clinical \u201ctriad\u201d of proximal muscle weakness, autonomic symptoms and reduced tendon reflexes. The estimated worldwide prevalence of LEMS is about 2.8 per million, making it a rare disease. There are approximately 400 known cases of LEMS in the United States. When LEMS is associated with SCLC, the patients tend to be older and are more likely to be men than women. The average age of onset of SCLC is around 60 years of age. Approximately 3% of SCLC patients develop LEMS, but clinical symptoms of LEMS usually precede the SCLC diagnosis (sometimes by many years). When LEMS is not related to cancer, the syndrome may occur at any age, and the typical onset is about 35 years of age.

About 30,000 people in the United States have Huntington\u2019s disease and another 200,000 are at risk of developing the condition. Symptoms commonly develop between ages 30 and 50. The disease progresses slowly and a person may live for another 15-20 years after the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis of Huntington's disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Specialized x-ray studies such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or electroencephalography (EEG) may help confirm the diagnosis of Huntington's Disease. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a file showing cross-sectional images of the brain. During MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves are used to create cross-sectional images of the brain. During an EEG, an instrument records electrical activity of the brain. Neuropsychological and/or genetic tests are also used to aid the diagnosis of Huntington's disease.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder", [26, 73]], ["dementia", [256, 263]], ["chorea", [362, 367]], ["Dementia", [463, 470]]], "rare_disease": [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["Huntington\u2019s disease", [957, 976]], ["Huntington's disease", [1211, 1230]], ["Huntington's Disease", [1519, 1538]], ["Huntington's disease", [1904, 1923]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements", [96, 146]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands", [96, 166]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet", [96, 172]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet, face", [96, 178]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet, face, and trunk", [96, 189]], ["dementia", [256, 263]], ["Neurologic movement abnormalities", [267, 299]], ["chorea", [362, 367]], ["athetosis", [374, 382]], ["slow, writhing involuntary movements", [425, 460]], ["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["progressive disorientation", [501, 526]], ["confusion", [532, 540]], ["personality disintegration", [543, 568]], ["impairment of memory control", [571, 598]], ["restlessness", [601, 612]], ["agitation", [615, 623]], ["pneumonia", [819, 827]], ["infections", [838, 847]], ["injuries", [850, 857]]], "anaphor": [["the disorder", [679, 690]], ["disease", [693, 699]], ["the condition", [1024, 1036]], ["The disease", [1089, 1099]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements", [96, 146]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands", [96, 166]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet", [96, 172]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet, face", [96, 178]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet, face, and trunk", [96, 189]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["dementia", [256, 263]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["Neurologic movement abnormalities", [267, 299]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["chorea", [362, 367]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["athetosis", [374, 382]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["slow, writhing involuntary movements", [425, 460]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["Dementia", [463, 470]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["progressive disorientation", [501, 526]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["confusion", [532, 540]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["personality disintegration", [543, 568]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["impairment of memory control", [571, 598]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["restlessness", [601, 612]]], [["Dementia", [463, 470]], ["agitation", [615, 623]]], [["the disorder", [679, 690]], ["pneumonia", [819, 827]]], [["the disorder", [679, 690]], ["infections", [838, 847]]], [["the disorder", [679, 690]], ["injuries", [850, 857]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["the disorder", [679, 690]]]], "is_a": [[["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder", [26, 73]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["disease", [693, 699]]], [["Huntington's disease", [0, 19]], ["the condition", [1024, 1036]]], [["Huntington's disease", [1211, 1230]], ["The disease", [1089, 1099]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["condition", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["dementia", "Loss of intellectual abilities interfering with an individual's social and occupational functions.

According to a recent retrospective study, to identify all diagnosed KS cases throughout Finland born during a defined time period, the minimal incidence of KS in Finland was approximately 1 in 48,000 newborns. There was a clear difference in estimates between boys (1 in 30,000) and girls (1 in 125,000). The reason for this sex ratio relates in part to the genetics and in part due to a bias of ascertainment wherein males with delayed puberty tend to seek care more frequently than do their female counterparts.

{"id": "Arteriovenous-Malformation", "text": "Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. In the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. Brain AVMs are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. The distribution of age at detection for brain AVMs is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30\u2019s. Although a small number of AVMs manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. The lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. The low resistance of the direct A-V connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the AVM. These high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the AVM and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. Further, because of the direct A-V connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the AVM and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. AVM can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. AVM are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. No environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological AVM. AVM does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of AVMs may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-AVM syndrome. AVM can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as Wyburn-Mason syndrome. AVM affects males and females in equal numbers. There does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. The best estimates for new detection of an AVM are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the U.S.) The population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the U.S. who harbor an AVM or have had an AVM that was treated.

{"id": "Aicardi-Syndrome", "text": "Aicardi syndrome typically begins as involuntary muscle spasms between four months and four years of age. Other symptoms may include epilepsy, intellectual disability, profound muscle weakness (hypotonia), an abnormally small head (microcephaly), abnormally small eyes (microphthalmia), an incomplete development of the retina and nerve in the back of the eye (colobomas), and/or abnormalities of the ribs and/or spinal column. Children of all ages with Aicardi syndrome have significant delay in motor development. Aicardi syndrome can be life-threatening during childhood due to complications from upper respiratory infections. Aicardi syndrome usually affects only females. In very rare cases, males with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) may have Aicardi syndrome. It has been estimated that there are between 300 and 500 cases of Aicardi syndrome worldwide. There do not appear to be any differences based on ethnicity or gender. It is usual to have an MRI of the brain. This study makes pictures of the brain to look for a small or missing corpus callosum and other problems with the formation of the brain. Individuals with Aicardi syndrome should have a test to look at the brain waves (EEG) to diagnose and treat seizures. An ophthalmologist should look into the eyes at the retina.

{"id": "Tolosa-Hunt-Syndrome", "text": "Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe periorbital headaches, along with decreased and painful eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). Symptoms usually affect only one eye (unilateral). In most cases, affected individuals experience intense sharp pain and decreased eye movements. Symptoms often will subside without intervention (spontaneous remission) and may recur without a distinct pattern (randomly). Affected individuals may exhibit signs of paralysis (palsy) of certain cranial nerves such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. The affected eye often abnormally protrudes (proptosis). The exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). While the exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is unknown, one theory is an abnormal autoimmune response linked with an inflammation in a specific area behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). In some cases, inflammation may be due to a clumping of a certain type of cell (granulomatous inflammation). Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body\u2019s natural defenses against \u201cforeign\u201d or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Other possible causes may include generalized inflammation and constricted or inflamed cranial blood vessels.

It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no \u201ctest\u201d to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful.

{"id": "Yunis-Varon-Syndrome", "text": "Yunis-Varon syndrome is a rare genetic multisystem disorder with defects affecting mostly the skeletal system, the nervous system, and ectodermal tissue (hair and teeth). It is characterized by large fontanelles, clavicular hypoplasia, characteristic facial features and/or abnormalities of fingers and toes. Characteristic features may include microcephaly, ear abnormalities, anteverted nares, midfacial hypoplasia, tented upper lip and small jaw (micrognathia), sparse or absent eyebrows and/or eyelashes. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes may include absence (aplasia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the fingers and toes. Most infants with this disorder experience severe feeding problems and respiratory difficulties. Some of these difficulties are related to the severe involvement of the central nervous system, with malformations of the brain affecting half of the children and hypotonia (low tone) affecting all of them. In addition, affected infants may have heart defects (e.g., abnormal enlargement of the heart muscle [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]). Frequently, feeding problems, respiratory difficulties, and/or heart defects may result in life-threatening complications during infancy. Yunis-Varon syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition.

{"id": "Legionnaires_-Disease", "text": "Legionnaires' Disease is recognized as an acute respiratory pneumonia caused by the aerobic gram-negative microorganism, Legionella pneumophila, and other species. This microorganism may also affect other body systems. Afflicted patients may have pulmonary (lung and bronchi), gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system complications. Renal insufficiency may occur occasionally and can be severe enough to require dialysis. The primary symptoms associated with Legionnaires\u2019 Disease appear to be pneumonia including a shaking chill, sharp pain in the involved side of the chest, cough with sputum or phlegm production, fever of up to 105\u00ba F, and, in some cases, rapid and painful respiration.  Abdominal pain, diarrhea, neurological signs such as headache, confusion, lethargy or agitation may also be present.  Laboratory data may include an abnormal liver function test, low phosphorus in the blood (hypophosphatemia), blood in the urine (hematuria), and low blood sodium (hyponatremia). Like Legionnaires\u2019 Disease, Pontiac Fever is caused by infection with bacteria belonging to the Legionella family.  Associated symptoms usually include a general feeling of ill health (malaise), fatigue, fever, chills, muscle aches (myalgia), and headache.  Some individuals with Pontiac Fever may also develop nausea, cough, joint aches (arthalgia), diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  The pneumonia seen in Legionnaires\u2019 Disease is not present.  Affected individuals usually recover without treatment (self-limiting illness) in a few days.  In those who develop Pontiac Fever, the time between initial infection and symptom onset (incubation period) is typically about one to two days.  In contrast, the incubation period for Legionnaires\u2019 Disease usually ranges from approximately two to 10 days.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["acute respiratory pneumonia", [42, 68]], ["Renal insufficiency", [343, 361]], ["pneumonia", [504, 512]], ["hypophosphatemia", [910, 925]], ["pneumonia", [1384, 1392]]], "rare_disease": [["Legionnaires' Disease", [0, 20]], ["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [1003, 1023]], ["Pontiac Fever", [1026, 1038]], ["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [1402, 1422]], ["Pontiac Fever", [1557, 1569]], ["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [1721, 1741]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["Renal insufficiency", [343, 361]], ["pneumonia", [504, 512]], ["shaking chill, sharp pain in the involved side of the chest,", [526, 585]], ["cough", [587, 591]], ["sputum", [598, 603]], ["phlegm", [608, 613]], ["fever", [627, 631]], ["rapid and painful respiration", [670, 698]], ["painful respiration", [680, 698]], ["Abdominal pain", [702, 715]], ["diarrhea", [718, 725]], ["neurological signs", [728, 745]], ["headache", [755, 762]], ["confusion", [765, 773]], ["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["agitation", [788, 796]], ["abnormal liver function", [851, 873]], ["hypophosphatemia", [910, 925]], ["hematuria", [949, 957]], ["hyponatremia", [983, 994]], ["malaise", [1183, 1189]], ["fatigue", [1193, 1199]], ["fever", [1202, 1206]], ["chills", [1209, 1214]], ["myalgia", [1231, 1237]], ["headache", [1245, 1252]], ["nausea", [1309, 1314]], ["cough", [1317, 1321]], ["arthalgia", [1337, 1345]], ["diarrhea", [1349, 1356]], ["abdominal pain", [1363, 1376]], ["pneumonia", [1384, 1392]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Legionnaires' Disease", [0, 20]], ["Renal insufficiency", [343, 361]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["pneumonia", [504, 512]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["shaking chill, sharp pain in the involved side of the chest,", [526, 585]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["cough", [587, 591]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["sputum", [598, 603]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["phlegm", [608, 613]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["fever", [627, 631]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["rapid and painful respiration", [670, 698]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["painful respiration", [680, 698]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["Abdominal pain", [702, 715]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["diarrhea", [718, 725]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["neurological signs", [728, 745]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["headache", [755, 762]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["confusion", [765, 773]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["lethargy", [776, 783]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["agitation", [788, 796]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["abnormal liver function", [851, 873]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["hypophosphatemia", [910, 925]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["hematuria", [949, 957]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [469, 489]], ["hyponatremia", [983, 994]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["agitation", [788, 796]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["abnormal liver function", [851, 873]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["hypophosphatemia", [910, 925]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["hypophosphatemia", [910, 925]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["hematuria", [949, 957]]], [["lethargy", [776, 783]], ["hyponatremia", [983, 994]]], [["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["nausea", [1309, 1314]]], [["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["cough", [1317, 1321]]], [["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["arthalgia", [1337, 1345]]], [["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["diarrhea", [1349, 1356]]], [["Pontiac Fever", [1278, 1290]], ["abdominal pain", [1363, 1376]]], [["Legionnaires\u2019 Disease", [1402, 1422]], ["pneumonia", [1384, 1392]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Legionnaires' Disease", [0, 20]], ["acute respiratory pneumonia", [42, 68]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["Disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["hypophosphatemia", "Lower than normal levels of phosphates in the circulating blood."], ["Renal insufficiency", "An acute or chronic condition that is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter the blood."], ["diarrhea", "The condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day."], ["pneumonia", "An acute, acute and chronic, or chronic inflammation focally or diffusely affecting the lung parenchyma, caused by an infection in one or both of the lungs (by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or mycoplasma.).

The symptoms of MMP vary among affected individuals depending upon the specific site(s) involved and the progression of the disease. Blistering lesions eventually heal, sometimes with scarring. Progressive scarring may potentially lead to serious complications affecting the eyes and throat. In some cases, blistering lesions also form on the skin, especially in the head and neck area. The exact cause of MMP is unknown. Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a rare group of autoimmune blistering disorders that affects females twice as often as males. The average age of onset of MMP is during the seventh decade (60 to 70 years of age). However, the disorder can occur at any age. The exact incidence of MMP is unknown. Because the disorder is difficult to identify, many researchers believe it is under-diagnosed. A diagnosis of MMP is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and certain tests known as a biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. For a biopsy, a small sample of skin tissue is removed (biopsy) and microscopically examined. For direct immunofluorescence, a second biopsied skin sample is tested to detect the presence of the specific autoantibodies (e.g., IgA, IgG, and C3) that cause pemphigoid.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["chronic autoimmune disorders", [52, 79]], ["autoimmune blistering disorders", [801, 831]]], "rare_disease": [["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [0, 25]], ["MMP", [28, 30]], ["MMP", [349, 351]], ["MMP", [739, 741]], ["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [755, 780]], ["MMP", [907, 909]], ["MMP", [1032, 1034]], ["MMP", [1158, 1160]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["blistering lesions", [98, 115]], ["Blistering lesions", [466, 483]], ["scarring", [517, 524]], ["Progressive scarring", [527, 546]], ["blistering lesions", [640, 657]]], "anaphor": [["the disease", [453, 463]], ["the disorder", [974, 985]], ["the disorder", [1056, 1067]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [0, 25]], ["blistering lesions", [98, 115]]], [["MMP", [349, 351]], ["Blistering lesions", [466, 483]]], [["MMP", [349, 351]], ["scarring", [517, 524]]], [["MMP", [349, 351]], ["Progressive scarring", [527, 546]]], [["MMP", [349, 351]], ["blistering lesions", [640, 657]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [0, 25]], ["chronic autoimmune disorders", [52, 79]]], [["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [755, 780]], ["autoimmune blistering disorders", [801, 831]]]], "is_acron": [[["MMP", [28, 30]], ["Mucous membrane pemphigoid", [0, 25]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["MMP", [349, 351]], ["the disease", [453, 463]]], [["MMP", [907, 909]], ["the disorder", [974, 985]]], [["MMP", [1032, 1034]], ["the disorder", [1056, 1067]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["skin", "A benign or malignant tumor involving the skin.

{"id": "Menkes-Disease", "text": "Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that is detectable before birth (prenatally) and which follows a progressively degenerative path involving several organs of the body but especially the brain. It is characterized by seizures, mental retardation, stunted growth, failure to thrive, unstable body temperature, and very unusual color and texture of hair. Menkes disease is characterized by brittle, tangled, sparse, steely or kinky hair that is often white, ivory, or gray in color.  Unusual facial features include pudgy cheeks and abnormal eyebrows.  Affected infants are often born prematurely. Lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and excess bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) may occur causing a yellow appearance (jaundice). Hypothermia may also occur in older infants.  In some cases, early symptoms may resolve, and normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for two to three months.  Severe developmental delay, loss of early development skills, and convulsions may occur.  Brain abnormalities such as a blood clot at the base of the brain (subdural hematoma) and/or rupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain not infrequently occur. Spastic dementia and seizures may eventually arise.  Weakened bones (osteoporosis) are common and can result in fractures. The combination of subdural hematoma and bone fractures may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of child abuse.  Emphysema, bladder abnormalities, degeneration of the retina and cysts of the iris have also been described. In rare cases, symptoms are very mild and only a few typical symptoms may appear. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of Menkes disease ranges from about 1 in 100,000 live births to 1 in 250,000 live births. Menkes disease is diagnosed by measurement of a decreased amount of copper and ceruloplasmin in blood plasma but these tests are not always reliable in the newborn period.  A new method of diagnosis that can potentially identify affected infants before copper deficiency affects the brain involves measurement of catecholamine levels in blood plasma.   Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the APT7A gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available if a specific ATP7A mutation in an affected family member.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["mental retardation", [251, 268]], ["jaundice",

{"id": "Roussy-Lvy-Syndrome", "text": "\"Roussy-L\u00e9vy Syndrome, also known as hereditary areflexic dystasia, is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that typically becomes apparent during early childhood. The disorder is characterized by incoordination, poor judgment of movements (sensory ataxia), and absence of reflexes (areflexia) of the lower legs and, eventually, the hands; weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of muscles of the lower legs; abnormally high arches of the feet with increased extension of the toes (pes cavus or \"\"clawfoot\"\"); and tremors of the hands. Many affected individuals also have an abnormal front-to-back and sideways curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). In individuals with Roussy-L\u00e9vy Syndrome, there is a failed communication of certain nerve signals to muscles of the lower legs (denervation). Roussy-Levy Syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Symptoms of Roussy-L\u00e9vy Syndrome are similar to other hereditary motor sensory neuropathies in that there is weakness and atrophy of the leg muscles with some loss of feeling.  People with this syndrome have difficulty walking and a lack of reflexes and deformity of the foot or feet (pes cavus). Roussy-L\u00e9vy differs, however, from other hereditary motor sensory neuropathies because of the very early onset of the disorder during childhood and its slowly progressive course.  Roussy-L\u00e9vy also has as one of its characteristics a slight tremor in the hands. Roussy-L\u00e9vy is a rare disorder that affects both sexes in equal numbers. Onset is during early childhood.

Characteristic facial features may include a pear-shaped or rounded (bulbous) nose; an abnormally long prominent groove (philtrum) in the upper lip; and/or abnormalities such as delayed eruption of teeth.

Additional features often include short stature (dwarfism) and/or additional skeletal abnormalities. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. TRPS3 is thought to have autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers.

The infection may be spread to humans through contact with pigeon droppings or unwashed raw fruit. Contact with an infected individual may also spread the infection. Individuals with disorders characterized by lowered immunity (for instance, HIV infection) are at high risk for contracting these infections. Cryptococcosis is caused by the fungus Cyptococcus neoformans.  It is spread by contact with pigeon droppings, unwashed raw fruit or by infected individuals.  People with immune deficiencies or lowered immunity (such as people undergoing cancer chemotherapy or organ transplants or those infected with HIV-AIDS) are at high risk for contracting this fungal infection. Cryptococcosis occurs worldwide.  In the United States it occurs predominately in the Southeastern states and usually in adults aged forty to sixty years of age.  It tends to occur more often in males than females. Individuals with disorders involving reduced or impaired immunity to infection are particularly at risk. The diagnosis depends on proof of the presence of Cyptococcus neoformans in either a bodily fluid or body tissue. The presence of the fungus may be seen under a light microscope in some circumstances; other circumstances require growing the organism from samples of fluid taken from a patient.

{"id": "Cystic-Fibrosis", "text": "CFTR A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be suspected based upon newborn screening, identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency) or a positive family history. The standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is the sweat test, a painless and simple procedure that measures the amount of salt in the sweat. Genetic testing can identify carriers of the defective gene. In May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DNA-based blood test to help detect cystic fibrosis. The Tag-It Cystic Fibrosis Kit directly analyzes human DNA to find genetic variations indicative of the disease. All 50 States have newborn screening for CF. In most states, immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) assays are performed on dried blood spots from newborns. Trypsinogen is synthesized in the pancreas and IRT levels are elevated in CF.

These nodules tend to be 1-2 centimeters large and most often affect the legs and feet (lower extremities). In most cases, idiopathic nodular panniculitis is associated with fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), muscle pain (myalgia), and/or abdominal pain. These symptoms may subside after a few days or weeks and may recur weeks, months, or years later. The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is not known (idiopathic). The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is unknown. There are numerous different causes that may be associated with the development of panniculitis including gout, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, iodide or bromide therapy, withdrawal from large doses of corticosteroids, or pancreatitis. Sometimes the cause may be identified as an allergy or possibly a predisposition of fatty tissue to a granulomatous reaction. A diagnosis of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of classic symptoms.

{"id": "Dubin-Johnson-Syndrome", "text": "Dubin Johnson Syndrome is a rare genetic liver disorder that tends to affect people of Middle Eastern Jewish heritage disproportionately to other groups. It appears to be associated with clotting factor VII in this population. Symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender. Jaundice, which is caused by excess bilirubin (bile pigment), is usually the only symptom of Dubin Johnson Syndrome.  Otherwise a physical examination is normal.  The disorder rarely appears before puberty.  Occasionally the patient may have an enlarged and tender liver and complain of weakness and a painful abdomen, but the liver will function normally. There may sometimes be a mild recurrence of the jaundice. Pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives may cause the disease to become apparent in women when no symptoms appeared previously. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The disorder can occur in all races.  However, among Iranian, Iraqi and Moroccan Jews the incidence is as high as 1 in 1300.  In Japan an unusually high incidence of Dubin-Johnson Syndrome was found in an isolated area where there was a high rate of intermarriage.  Age at onset can be anytime between 10 weeks of age to 56 years. Treatment of Dubin Johnson Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. In many cases patients may require no treatment even though they have recurrent mild jaundice. However, metabolism of certain drugs may be affected in patients with Dubin-Johnson Syndrome since many pharmaceutical products are metabolized in the liver. Therefore, medications should be carefully supervised by a physician. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families affected by Dubin Johnson Syndrome.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["genetic liver disorder", [33, 54]], ["classic genetic diseases", [989, 1012]], ["recessive disorders", [1122, 1140]], ["recessive disorder", [1513, 1530]]], "rare_disease": [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [0, 21]], ["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [434, 455]], ["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [884, 905]], ["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [1865, 1886]], ["Dubin-Johnson Syndrome", [2122, 2143]], ["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [2300, 2321]], ["Dubin-Johnson Syndrome", [2519, 2540]], ["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [2758, 2779]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["jaundice", [279, 286]], ["liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender", [296, 338]], ["Jaundice", [341, 348]], ["excess bilirubin", [370, 385]], ["enlarged and tender liver", [586, 610]], ["weakness", [628, 635]], ["painful abdomen", [643, 657]], ["jaundice", [746, 753]], ["recurrent mild jaundice", [2424, 2446]]], "anaphor": [["It", [154, 155]], ["The disorder", [504, 515]], ["the disease", [806, 816]], ["The disorder", [1956, 1967]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["enlarged and tender liver", [586, 610]], ["genetic liver disorder", [33, 54]]], [["enlarged and tender liver", [586, 610]], ["Dubin-Johnson Syndrome", [2122, 2143]]], [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [434, 455]], ["Jaundice", [341, 348]]], [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [434, 455]], ["excess bilirubin", [370, 385]]], [["The disorder", [504, 515]], ["enlarged and tender liver", [586, 610]]], [["The disorder", [504, 515]], ["weakness", [628, 635]]], [["The disorder", [504, 515]], ["painful abdomen", [643, 657]]], [["The disorder", [504, 515]], ["jaundice", [746, 753]]], [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [2300, 2321]], ["recurrent mild jaundice", [2424, 2446]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [0, 21]], ["genetic liver disorder", [33, 54]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [434, 455]], ["The disorder", [504, 515]]], [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [434, 455]], ["the disease", [806, 816]]], [["Dubin Johnson Syndrome", [1865, 1886]], ["The disorder", [1956, 1967]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["condition", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["diseases", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["Syndrome", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["skin", "A benign or malignant tumor involving the skin.

{"id": "Fragile-X-Syndrome", "text": "Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild intellectual disability in affected females. Distinctive physical features are sometimes present in affected males including a large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears, loose joints and large testes, but these features develop over time and may not be obvious until puberty. Motor and language delays are usually present but also become more apparent over time. Behavioral abnormalities including autistic behaviors are common. Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild intellectual disability in affected females. The physical features in affected males are variable and may not be obvious until puberty. These symptoms can include a large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears, loose joints and large testes. Other symptoms can include flat feet, frequent ear infections, low muscle tone, a long narrow face, high arched palate, dental problems, crossed eyes (strabismus) and heart problems including mitral valve prolapse. Delayed motor development, hyperactivity, behavior problems, toe walking, and/or occasional seizures can also occur in some patients. Autistic behaviors such as poor eye contact, hand flapping, and/or self-stimulating behaviors are also common. Motor and language delays are usually present but become more apparent over time. The fragile X syndrome affects about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 females in the USA; that is, it affects about twice as many males as it does females. However, about four times as many females appear to be carriers of the altered gene as do males (1:250 females and 1:1000 males). Fragile X syndrome has been found in all major ethnic groups and races.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["intellectual disability", [48, 70]], ["intellectual disability", [99, 121]],

{"id": "Townes-Brocks-Syndrome", "text": "Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. Abnormalities in the feet, heart and kidneys also occur frequently. Townes-Brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the SALL1 gene. The absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus) is the most common feature of TBS.   Small ears and a folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear are usually present.  Congenital sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss can range from mild to severe and can be progressive.   The most common thumb malformations are three bones instead of two (triphalangeal thumbs) and duplicated thumbs (preaxial polydactyly).  Feet anomalies occur less frequently and include a short third toe, overlapping toes and flat feet.  Kidney dysfunction can occur with or without kidney malformations.   Typical kidney anomalies include displaced or rotated kidneys, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, and underdeveloped kidneys.  Abnormalities of the heart, eye and spine are infrequently associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  Mental retardation occurs in approximately 10% of affected individuals. Townes-Brocks syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease.  The SALL1 gene is the only gene known to be associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.  Approximately 50% of affected individuals have the condition as a result of a new mutation.  The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. The prevalence of Townes-Brock syndrome is not known but has been estimated to be at least 1 in 250,000 births.  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The diagnosis of Townes-Brocks syndrome is based on clinical symptoms. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the SALL1 gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["autosomal dominant genetic disorder", [35, 69]], ["imperforate

{"id": "Dandy-Walker-Malformation", "text": "Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM. The frequency of Dandy Walker malformation in the US is approximately 1 per 25,000 -35,000 live births and affects more females than males. Dandy Walker malformation is diagnosed with the use of ultrasound, CT and MRI. Prenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is sometimes made by ultrasound or fetal MRI.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["brain malformation", [37, 54]], ["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["genetic syndrome", [1691, 1706]]], "rare_disease": [["Dandy-Walker malformation", [0, 24]], ["DWM", [27, 29]], ["DWM", [375, 377]], ["DWM", [620, 622]], ["DWM", [927, 929]], ["isolated Dandy-Walker malformation", [1429, 1462]], ["CVH", [1571, 1573]], ["DWM", [1591, 1593]], ["DWM", [1659, 1661]], ["PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma", [1758, 1793]], ["DWM", [1826, 1828]], ["DWM", [1906, 1908]], ["CVH", [1944, 1946]], ["DWM", [1968, 1970]], ["Dandy Walker malformation", [1990, 2014]], ["Dandy Walker malformation", [2113, 2137]], ["Dandy-Walker malformation", [2214, 2238]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis", [399, 517]], ["cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle", [520, 558]], ["enlargement of the base of the skull", [564, 599]], ["blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l", [686, 730]], ["excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain", [739, 801]], ["high pressure within the skull", [829, 858]], ["swelling of the head", [864, 883]], ["neurological impairment", [902, 924]], ["defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures", [944, 1026]], ["chromosome abnormalities", [1050, 1073]], ["multiple birth defects", [1722, 1743]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l", [686, 730]], ["excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain", [739, 801]]], [["blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l", [686, 730]], ["high pressure within the skull", [829, 858]]], [["blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l", [686, 730]], ["swelling of the head", [864, 883]]], [["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid l", [686, 730]]], [["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain", [739, 801]]], [["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["high pressure within the skull", [829, 858]]], [["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["swelling of the head", [864, 883]]], [["hydrocephalus", [662, 674]], ["neurological impairment", [902, 924]]], [["DWM", [927, 929]], ["defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures", [944, 1026]]], [["DWM", [927, 929]], ["chromosome abnormalities", [1050, 1073]]], [["PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma", [1758, 1793]], ["multiple birth defects", [1722, 1743]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Dandy-Walker malformation", [0, 24]], ["brain malformation", [37, 54]]], [["PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma", [1758, 1793]], ["genetic syndrome", [1691, 1706]]]], "is_acron": [[["DWM", [27, 29]], ["Dandy-Walker malformation", [0, 24]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["hydrocephalus", "A disorder characterized by an abnormal increase of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain."], ["syndrome", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["syndromes", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["hemangioma", "A benign vascular lesion characterized by the formation of capillary-sized or cavernous vascular channels."], ["as", "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening.

{"id": "Hereditary-Hyperphosphatasia", "text": "Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings. Affected individuals also have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and other biochemical markers of bone turnover, detectable through blood and urine tests.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["osteopathy", [62, 71]], ["Paget's disease", [550, 564]], ["focal skeletal disorder", [569, 591]]], "rare_disease": [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [497, 524]], ["juvenile Paget's disease", [686, 709]], ["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [781, 808]], ["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [858, 885]], ["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [1161, 1188]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["progressive skeletal malformations", [168, 201]], ["Skeletal malformations in the legs", [254, 287]], ["problems walking", [299, 314]], ["short stature", [345, 357]], ["pain", [388, 391]], ["fractures of affected bones", [394, 420]], ["muscle weakness", [427, 441]], ["abnormal bone turnover", [620, 641]], ["elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase", [1388, 1432]]], "anaphor": [["the disorder", [645, 656]], ["two disorders", [753, 765]], ["it", [960, 961]], ["the disorder", [1079, 1090]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["progressive skeletal malformations", [168, 201]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["Skeletal malformations in the legs", [254, 287]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["problems walking", [299, 314]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["short stature", [345, 357]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["pain", [388, 391]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["fractures of affected bones", [394, 420]]], [["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["muscle weakness", [427, 441]]], [["Paget's disease", [550, 564]], ["abnormal bone turnover", [620, 641]]], [["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [1161, 1188]], ["elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase", [1388, 1432]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [0, 27]], ["osteopathy", [62, 71]]], [["Paget's disease", [550, 564]], ["focal skeletal disorder", [569, 591]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [497, 524]], ["two disorders", [753, 765]]], [["juvenile Paget's disease", [686, 709]], ["the disorder", [645, 656]]], [["juvenile Paget's disease", [686, 709]], ["two disorders", [753, 765]]], [["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [497, 524]], ["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [1161, 1188]]], [["hereditary hyperphosphatasia", [497, 524]], ["elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase", [1388, 1432]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["all", ""], ["bone disorder", "Diseases of bones."], ["Paget's disease", "A malignant neoplasm composed of large cells with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant pale cytoplasm (Paget cells).

{"id": "Progressive-Symmetric-Erythrokeratodermia", "text": "Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK) represents a group of rare genetic skin disorders characterized by well-demarcated plaques of reddened, dry, and thickened skin. Typically, these lesions are distributed symmetrically on the body and tend to slowly expand and progress over time. The severity and progression of the disorder can vary greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. In some families, PSEK can be part of the clinical spectrum of other rare skin disorders, such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis or loricrin keratoderma. In the majority, the molecular cause of PSEKis not known. The symptoms of PSEK usually develop shortly after birth or during the first year of life. Infants develop reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, especially on the face, buttocks, arms and legs. Over time, these lesions can cover large areas of the body. The distribution of these lesions is almost perfectly symmetrical, meaning the size, shape and location of the lesions are extremely similar on both sides of the body. These plaques are slowly progressive increasing in number and size throughout early childhood before either stabilizing or disappearing sometime later during life. Rarely, waxing and waning may occur. In some cases, the chest and abdomen may become involved. Abnormally thickened or calloused skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) is not uncommon. PSEK affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Darier in 1911.

{"id": "Zellweger-Spectrum-Disorders", "text": "Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of rare, genetic, multisystem disorders that were once thought to be separate entities. These disorders are now classified as different expressions (variants) of one disease process. Collectively, they form a spectrum or continuum of disease. Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy is the intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease is the mildest form. Zellweger spectrum disorders can affect most organs of the body. Neurological deficits, loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), hearing loss, vision problems, liver dysfunction, and kidney abnormalities are common findings. Zellweger spectrum disorders often result in severe, life-threatening complications early during infancy. Some individuals with milder forms have lived into adulthood. Zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Zellweger spectrum disorders are also known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) - a group of disorders characterized by the failure of the body to produce peroxisomes that function properly. Peroxisomes are very small, membrane-bound structures within the gel-like fluid (cytoplasm) of cells that play a vital role in numerous biochemical processes in the body. PBDs are subdivided into the three Zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.\u00a0 Zellweger spectrum disorders are usually apparent at birth. They affect individuals of all ethnic groups. In the United States, the combined incidence of these disorders is at least 1 in 50,000 live births.

{"id": "Dentin-Dysplasia-Type-I", "text": "\"Dentin dysplasia type I is an inherited disorder characterized by atypical development of the \"\"dentin\"\" of a person's teeth. Dentin makes up most of the tooth and is the bone-like material under the enamel. It serves to contain the pulp of the tooth. The pulp is a soft tissue that is well supplied with blood vessels and nerves. This disorder is also known as radicular dentin dysplasia because the underdeveloped, abnormal pulp tissue is predominately in the roots of the teeth. The teeth lack pulp chambers or have half-moon shaped pulp chambers in short or abnormally shaped roots. The condition may affect juvenile as well as adult teeth and, since the roots are abnormally short, usually leads to the premature loss of teeth.  The color of the teeth is usually normal. Dentin dysplasia type I appears to affect about 1 in 100,000 persons.  Males and females are apparently equally at risk.

Approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of hereditary lymphedema may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized imaging tests including lymphoscintigraphy, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During lymphoscintigraphy, a radioactively labeled colloid substance is injected intradermally into either the hands or feet. The time required for the tracer to be transported from the point of injection to the regional lymph nodes is recorded. In congenital lymphedema, the tracer may move\u00a0sluggishly or not move from the site of injection. During an ultrasound, reflected sound waves create an image of the developing fetus. An ultrasound is used to rule out other conditions. A Doppler ultrasound can evaluate venous conditions such as varicose veins and venous blood clots. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues.

{"id": "Ichthyosis-X-Linked", "text": "X-linked ichthyosis is a genetic skin disorder that affects males. It is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid sulfatase. Under normal conditions, this enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) cholesterol sulfate, a member of the chemical family of steroids. Cholesterol sulfate plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the skin. If steroid metabolism is interrupted and cholesterol sulfate accumulates in the skin cells, the skin cells stick together more strongly than usual. The normal shedding of dead skin cells is inhibited and the skin cells build up and clump into scales. X-linked recessive disorders are conditions that are coded on the X chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.  Therefore, in females, the normal gene on one X chromosome can mask disease traits on the other X chromosome.  Since males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit the gene for a disease present on the X they will express the disease.  Men with X-linked disorders transmit the gene to all their daughters, who are carriers, but never to their sons.  Women who are carriers of an X-linked disorder have a 50 percent chance of transmitting the carrier condition to their daughters and a 50 percent risk of transmitting the disease to their sons.

These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["tumor of the salivary glands", [55, 82]]], "rare_disease": [["Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma", [0, 36]], ["PLGA", [39, 42]], ["PLGA", [1438, 1441]], ["PLGA", [1676, 1679]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["lump or mass in the palate", [758, 783]], ["lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands", [758, 818]], ["lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands", [874, 922]], ["salivary glands (asymmetry)", [1005, 1031]], ["Unexplained bleeding in the mouth", [1078, 1110]], ["persistent numbness on any part of the face", [1160, 1202]], ["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]]], "anaphor": [["this disease", [1608, 1619]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["tumor of the salivary glands", [55, 82]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["this disease", [1608, 1619]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["lump or mass in the palate", [758, 783]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["PLGA", [1676, 1679]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands", [758, 818]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands", [874, 922]]], [["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["salivary glands (asymmetry)", [1005, 1031]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]], ["PLGA", [39, 42]]]], "is_acron": [[["PLGA", [39, 42]], ["weakening of the muscles on one side of the face", [1209, 1256]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["PLGA", [1438, 1441]], ["this disease", [1608, 1619]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["adenocarcinoma", "A common cancer characterized by the presence of malignant glandular cells.

{"id": "Refractory-Celiac-Disease", "text": "Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a complex autoimmune disorder much like the more common celiac disease but, unlike celiac disease, it is resistant or unresponsive to at least 12 months of treatment with a strict gluten-free diet. Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma. Treatment involving other immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, enteric-coated budesonide, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), or inflixamab has been used with a limited number of patients.  More recently chemotherapy with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be useful.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["complex autoimmune disorder", [37, 63]], ["celiac disease", [91, 104]], ["celiac disease", [118, 131]], ["celiac disease", [394, 407]], ["hypogammaglobulinemia", [692, 712]], ["celiac disease", [1054, 1067]], ["intestinal disorders", [1762, 1781]]], "rare_disease": [["Refractory celiac disease", [0, 24]], ["RCD", [27, 29]], ["RCD", [427, 429]], ["intestinal lymphoma", [613, 631]], ["Crohn's disease", [634, 648]], ["Refractory celiac disease", [715, 739]], ["RCD", [852, 854]], ["RCD", [1101, 1103]], ["RCD", [1120, 1122]], ["Type I RCD", [1148, 1157]], ["refractory celiac disease", [1194, 1218]], ["refractory celiac disease", [1453, 1477]], ["RCD", [1794, 1796]], ["Type II RCD", [2276, 2286]], ["lymphoma", [2436, 2443]], ["RCD", [2468, 2470]], ["lymphoma", [3013, 3020]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["small intestinal inflammation and injury", [1952, 1991]]], "anaphor": [["it", [134, 135]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["RCD", [1794, 1796]], ["small intestinal inflammation and injury", [1952, 1991]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["celiac disease", [1054, 1067]], ["RCD", [1101, 1103]]]], "is_a": [[["Type I RCD", [1148, 1157]], ["RCD", [1120, 1122]]]], "is_acron": [[["RCD", [27, 29]], ["Refractory celiac disease", [0, 24]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Refractory celiac disease", [0, 24]], ["it", [134, 135]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["lymphoma", "A malignant (clonal) proliferation of B- lymphocytes or T- lymphocytes which involves the lymph nodes, bone marrow and/or extranodal sites.

{"id": "Weismann-Netter-Stuhl-Syndrome", "text": "Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized by the abnormal development of bone (osseousbo dysplasia).

In some individuals, other bones may also be affected, such as the ribs, pelvis, spinal column, and/or bones in the arms. Affected individuals will have some degree of short stature, which means that they are shorter than would otherwise be expected based on their gender and age. The medical definition states that short stature is two standard deviations or more below the mean for children of the same age and gender. The final height of affected individuals will vary. Researchers believe that alterations (mutations) in a gene result in Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome. However, they have not been able to find such a gene. Researchers also believe that the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare skeletal disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 70 people have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder\u2019s original description in 1954.

{"id": "Sneddon-Syndrome", "text": "Sneddon syndrome is a rare progressive disorder affecting small- and medium-sized blood vessels. The disorder is characterized by the association of a skin condition and neurological abnormalities. Characteristic findings include multiple episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia) causing mini-strokes or stroke and bluish net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin surrounding normal-appearing skin (livedo reticularis). Additional symptoms may include headache, dizziness, abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension), and heart disease. Lesions may develop within the central nervous system as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain, which can cause reduced intellectual ability, memory loss, personality changes, and/or other neurological symptoms. The combination of stroke symptoms and livedo reticularis differentiates this syndrome from other disorders. The exact cause of Sneddon syndrome is not fully understood. Sneddon syndrome has been reported more often in females than in males. Almost 80% of the patients are women with a median age of diagnosis at 40 years.

In fact, primary CNS lymphoma is the most common brain tumor in immunosuppressed patients. The other main risk factor for developing a PCNSL is age. Most immunocompetent patients are diagnosed around age 60, although cases of PCNSL have also been reported in children. AIDS-related PCNSL most often develop during the fifth decade of life (age 40-49).", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["brain tumors", [62, 73]], ["HIV", [427, 429]], ["AIDS", [432, 435]], ["congenital immunodeficiency syndromes", [614, 650]], ["brain tumor", [702, 712]]], "rare_disease": [["Primary central nervous system lymphoma", [0, 38]], ["PCNSL", [214, 218]], ["primary CNS lymphoma", [307, 326]], ["primary CNS lymphoma", [662, 681]], ["PCNSL", [788, 792]], ["PCNSL", [879, 883]], ["AIDS-related PCNSL", [922, 939]]], "symptom_and_sign": [], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [], "increases_risk_of": [[["HIV", [427, 429]], ["primary CNS lymphoma", [307, 326]]], [["AIDS", [432, 435]], ["primary CNS lymphoma", [307, 326]]], [["congenital immunodeficiency syndromes", [614, 650]], ["primary CNS lymphoma", [307, 326]]]], "is_a": [[["Primary central nervous system lymphoma", [0, 38]], ["brain tumors", [62, 73]]], [["primary CNS lymphoma", [662, 681]], ["brain tumor", [702, 712]]]], "is_acron": [[["PCNSL", [214, 218]], ["Primary central nervous system lymphoma", [0, 38]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["syndromes", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["Primary central nervous system lymphoma", "A non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain or spinal cord as a primary lesion.

The range and severity of symptoms varies from case to case. All reported cases of Mulvihill-Smith syndrome have occurred as isolated cases.

A diagnosis may be confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. For example, hearing tests may be performed to determine the range and severity of hearing impairment in each individual. Pigmented nevi may be present at birth (congenital) or shortly after birth.

{"id": "Focal-Segmental-Glomerulosclerosis", "text": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a term for a specific pattern of damage to the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs in the body, one on each side of the body just below the rib cage in the back. The kidney has multiple functions including filtering the blood of waste products and other substances and producing urine to carrying waste from the body. FSGS occurs when the filters of the kidney, which are made of clusters of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and known as renal glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis). Each kidney has about a million glomeruli, which are part of a larger structure called the nephron; the nephron is the basic unit of the kidneys. The glomeruli help to filter out waste products and extra fluid from the blood. Scarring or damage to the glomeruli can lead to an inability of the kidneys to process waste products and eliminate those waste products from the body through the urine. Ultimately, these abnormalities lead to progressive kidney damage including decreased function and efficiency of the kidneys, and potentially kidney failure. There are different causes of FSGS and, in some instances, the cause is unknown. Depending on the cause, FSGS may be treated with certain medications, but sometimes despite treatment affected individuals will eventually require dialysis or a kidney transplant.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["kidney failure", [1090, 1103]]], "rare_disease": [["Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis", [0, 33]], ["FSGS", [36, 39]], ["FSGS", [375, 378]], ["FSGS", [1136, 1139]], ["FSGS", [1211, 1214]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["damage to the kidneys", [78, 98]], ["glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis)", [501, 549]], ["Scarring or damage to the glomeruli", [778, 812]], ["progressive kidney damage", [988, 1012]], ["kidney failure", [1090, 1103]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis", [0, 33]], ["damage to the kidneys", [78, 98]]], [["FSGS", [375, 378]], ["glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis)", [501, 549]]], [["FSGS", [375, 378]], ["Scarring or damage to the glomeruli", [778, 812]]], [["FSGS", [375, 378]], ["progressive kidney damage", [988, 1012]]], [["FSGS", [375, 378]], ["kidney failure", [1090, 1103]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [[["FSGS", [36, 39]], ["Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis", [0, 33]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["glomerulosclerosis", "A hardening of the kidney glomerulus caused by scarring of the blood vessels."], ["kidney failure", "An acute or chronic condition that is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter the blood."], ["Scarring", "A permanent mark left on the skin in the process of wound healing."], ["as", "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening.

{"id": "Hashimoto-Encephalopathy", "text": "Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare disorder characterized by impaired brain function (encephalopathy). The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder or a disorder in which there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system. Affected individuals have the presence of antithyroid antibodies in their body. Antibodies are part of the immune system; they are specialized proteins that target foreign or invading organisms. Antithyroid antibodies are ones that mistakenly target thyroid tissue. However, it is unclear whether these antibodies play any role in the development of Hashimoto encephalopathy or are a coincidental finding. The main signs and symptoms are related to the encephalopathy. The onset of impaired brain function is rapid (acute), while other times it can develop slowly over many years. The specific symptoms, severity, and course of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. The disorder often responds to therapy with corticosteroids. Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare disease that affects women more often than men. The disorder is estimated to affect 2.1 per 100,000 individuals in the general population. It can affect children, but only approximately 60 affected children have been described in the medical literature.

{"id": "Mesenteric-Panniculitis", "text": "The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis.

These symptoms may include a burning and heavy feeling in the pit of the stomach, mild nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weakness.  In severe cases there can be bleeding of the stomach which may result in anemia.  Some people with this disorder, especially chronic aspirin users, may show no apparent symptoms until the disease has advanced.  An accurate diagnosis can be made by physician\u2019s  visual inspection of the stomach using a gastroscope. The exact cause of Chronic, Erosive Gastritis is unknown.  It may be the result of an infection, over indulgence of alcohol, or persistent use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. Stress tends to make symptoms worse.  Crohn\u2019s disease and Sarcoidosis have been known to be factors in some cases of Chronic, Erosive Gastritis, while some cases have no apparent cause at all.

{"id": "Sweet-Syndrome", "text": "Sweet syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by fever and the sudden onset of a rash, which consists of multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps or lesions. These lesions usually occur on the arms, legs, trunk, face or neck. In some cases, additional systems of the body can become involved including the musculoskeletal system such as inflammation of the joints (arthritis), the eyes such as inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs. In the majority of affected individuals, the disorder occurs by itself for no known reason (idiopathic Sweet syndrome); this is also known as classical Sweet syndrome. Less often, the disorder can be associated with an underlying cancer (malignancy), usually a blood (hematologic) cancer such as certain types of leukemia; this is known as malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. The disorder can also result as a reaction to taking certain drugs, especially a drug known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; this is known as drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is treated with corticosteroids. Classical Sweet syndrome in adults affects women more often than men by as much as 15:1 by some estimates. This female preponderance has not been seen in malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Classical Sweet syndrome usually affects women between the ages of 30-50, but can be seen in individuals of any age including children. There is no gender predominance seen in children. Several hundred individuals of Sweet syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Only approximately 80 children have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. In many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue may reveal the infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis. A complete blood cell count may also show neutrophils in the blood (neutrophilia).", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["cancer", [737, 742]], ["blood (hematologic) cancer", [768, 793]]], "rare_disease": [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["idiopathic Sweet syndrome", [599, 623]], ["classical Sweet syndrome", [649, 672]], ["leukemia", [820, 827]], ["malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome", [847, 882]], ["drug-induced Sweet syndrome", [1036, 1062]], ["Sweet syndrome", [1065, 1078]], ["Classical Sweet syndrome", [1113, 1136]], ["malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome", [1267, 1318]], ["drug-induced Sweet syndrome", [1292, 1318]], ["Classical Sweet syndrome", [1321, 1344]], ["Sweet syndrome", [1538, 1551]], ["Sweet syndrome", [1691, 1704]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["fever", [51, 55]], ["rash", [83, 86]], ["multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps", [107, 146]], ["lesions", [151, 157]], ["lesions", [166, 172]], ["arthritis", [367, 375]], ["inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs", [396, 504]], ["conjunctivitis", [465, 478]]], "anaphor": [["the disorder", [548, 559]], ["the disorder", [687, 698]], ["The disorder", [885, 896]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["fever", [51, 55]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["rash", [83, 86]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps", [107, 146]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["lesions", [151, 157]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["lesions", [166, 172]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["arthritis", [367, 375]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs", [396, 504]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["conjunctivitis", [465, 478]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["the disorder", [548, 559]], ["Sweet syndrome", [1538, 1551]]], [["leukemia", [820, 827]], ["blood (hematologic) cancer", [768, 793]]], [["malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome", [847, 882]], ["the disorder", [687, 698]]], [["drug-induced Sweet syndrome", [1036, 1062]], ["The disorder", [885, 896]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [[["the disorder", [548, 559]], ["conjunctivitis", [465, 478]]]], "anaphora": [[["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["the disorder", [548, 559]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["the disorder", [687, 698]]], [["Sweet syndrome", [0, 13]], ["The disorder", [885, 896]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["syndrome", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["skin", "A benign or malignant tumor involving the skin.

{"id": "Ichthyosis-Vulgaris", "text": "In ichthyosis vulgaris, the skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not shed normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) and are not shed as quickly as they should be. The result is a build-up of scale. Fine scales usually develop on the back and over muscles near the joints, such as an elbow or knee (extensor muscles). Ichthyosis is usually most common and severe over the lower legs. Ichthyosis vulgaris is an inherited disorder transmitted through an autosomal dominant inheritance.  The specific genetic defect that causes ichthyosis vulgaris is not yet identified.  Human traits, including classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or the father) will be expressed, dominating the other normal gene and resulting in the appearance of the disease.  In the case of ichthyosis vulgaris, the gene for the disease overrides the gene for normal skin and the individual shows the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from an affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy, regardless of the sex of the child. Ichthyosis vulgaris is a fairly common disorder that affects approximately one in 250 persons in the United States.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Ichthyosis vulgaris is treated topically with moisturizers containing urea or glycerol. Lotions containing alpha-hydroxy acids may help. However, some individuals with ichthyosis vulgaris also may experience atopic dermatitis (red, itchy patches of skin) and the alpha-hydroxy acids may irritate their skin.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["ichthyosis vulgaris", [3, 21]], ["Ichthyosis", [365, 374]], ["Ichthyosis vulgaris", [431, 449]], ["inherited disorder", [457, 474]], ["ichthyosis vulgaris", [572, 590]], ["genetic diseases", [648, 663]], ["dominant disorders", [792, 809]], ["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1010, 1028]], ["Ichthyosis vulgaris", [1275, 1293]], ["Ichthyosis vulgaris", [1441, 1459]], ["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1609, 1627]], ["atopic dermatitis", [1649, 1665]]], "rare_disease": [], "symptom_and_sign": [["scale", [239, 243]], ["Fine scales", [246, 256]], ["atopic dermatitis", [1649, 1665]]], "anaphor": [["the disease", [1044, 1054]], ["the disease", [1116, 1126]], ["the disorder", [1155, 1166]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["ichthyosis vulgaris", [3, 21]], ["scale", [239, 243]]], [["ichthyosis vulgaris", [3, 21]], ["Fine scales", [246, 256]]], [["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1609, 1627]], ["atopic dermatitis", [1649, 1665]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Ichthyosis vulgaris", [431, 449]], ["inherited disorder", [457, 474]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1010, 1028]], ["the disease", [1044, 1054]]], [["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1010, 1028]], ["the disease", [1116, 1126]]], [["ichthyosis vulgaris", [1010, 1028]], ["the disorder", [1155, 1166]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["condition", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["diseases", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["dermatitis", "An inflammatory process affecting the skin.

{"id": "Dystonia", "text": "Dystonia is a general term for a large group of movement disorders that vary in their symptoms, causes, progression, and treatments. This group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures).\u00a0The muscular contractions may be sustained or come and go (intermittent). Movements may be patterned and twisting, and/or in some cases shaking or quivering (tremulous) resembling a tremor. Dystonia may occur or be worsened when an individual attempts a voluntary action. There are many different causes for dystonia. Genetic as well as non-genetic factors can contribute to the development of these disorders. In some cases, the exact, underlying cause is unknown (idiopathic). The most characteristic finding associated with most forms of dystonia is twisting, repetitive movements that affect the neck, torso, limbs, eyes, face, vocal chords, and/or a combination of these muscle groups. Certain forms such as laryngeal dystonia are not associated with abnormal postures. Dystonia causes varying degrees of pain and disability that ranges from mild symptoms that come and go to severe, debilitating symptoms that can significantly affect a person\u2019s quality of life. In some cases dystonia can become progressively worse, while in others it remains unchanged or no longer worsens (plateaus). Dystonia may even spontaneously remit in rare cases. Treatment for dystonia depends upon several factors including the specific subtype present and can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy and surgery. Dystonia can affect individuals of any age, gender, race, or ethnic background. It is estimated that as many as 300,000 people in North America may be affected by the various forms of dystonia. However, because many cases of dystonia go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of dystonia in the general population is difficult. Focal forms of dystonia are approximately 10 times more common than generalized forms.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["Dystonia", [0, 7]], ["movement disorders", [48, 65]], ["neurological conditions", [147, 169]], ["Dystonia", [513, 520]], ["dystonia", [631, 638]], ["dystonia", [864, 871]], ["laryngeal dystonia", [1036, 1053]], ["Dystonia", [1098, 1105]], ["dystonia", [1306, 1313]], ["Dystonia", [1417, 1424]], ["dystonia", [1484, 1491]], ["Dystonia", [1648, 1655]], ["dystonia", [1832, 1839]], ["dystonia", [1873, 1880]], ["dystonia", [1948, 1955]], ["dystonia", [2012, 2019]]], "rare_disease": [], "symptom_and_sign": [["involuntary muscle contractions", [201, 231]], ["abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions", [258, 309]], ["muscular contractions", [327, 347]], ["tremor", [505, 510]], ["twisting, repetitive movements", [876, 905]], ["pain", [1133, 1136]], ["disability", [1142, 1151]]], "anaphor": [["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]], ["these disorders", [717, 731]], ["it", [1363, 1364]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]], ["involuntary muscle contractions", [201, 231]]], [["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]], ["abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions", [258, 309]]], [["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]], ["muscular contractions", [327, 347]]], [["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]], ["tremor", [505, 510]]], [["dystonia", [864, 871]], ["twisting, repetitive movements", [876, 905]]], [["Dystonia", [1098, 1105]], ["pain", [1133, 1136]]], [["Dystonia", [1098, 1105]], ["disability", [1142, 1151]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Dystonia", [0, 7]], ["movement disorders", [48, 65]]], [["Dystonia", [0, 7]], ["neurological conditions", [147, 169]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Dystonia", [0, 7]], ["This group of neurological conditions", [133, 169]]], [["dystonia", [631, 638]], ["these disorders", [717, 731]]], [["dystonia", [631, 638]], ["dystonia", [1948, 1955]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["laryngeal dystonia", "A chronic voice disorder characterized by momentary periods of uncontrolled spasms of the muscles of the larynx."], ["Dystonia", "A movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions, resulting in abnormal movements and/or postures."], ["movement disorders", "Neurological conditions resulting in abnormal voluntary or involuntary movement, which may impact the speed, fluency, quality and ease of movement."], ["as", "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening.

{"id": "Renal-Cell-Carcinoma", "text": "Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.

{"id": "Leiomyosarcoma", "text": "Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle Cells There are essentially two types of muscles in the body - voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles - the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. Smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. Smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. Leiomyosarcomas affect both males and females. Leiomyosarcoma is a form of soft tissue sarcoma.

{"id": "Anemia-Megaloblastic", "text": "Megaloblastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). Bone marrow, the soft spongy material found inside certain bones, produces the main blood cells of the body -red cells, white cells, and platelets. Anemia is a condition characterized by the low levels of circulating, red blood cells. Red blood cells are released from the marrow into the bloodstream where they travel throughout the body delivering oxygen to tissue. A deficiency in healthy, fully-matured red blood cells can result in fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness and additional findings. Megaloblastic anemia has several different causes - deficiencies of either cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate (vitamin B9) are the two most common causes. These vitamins play an essential role in the production of red blood cells. Megaloblastic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. It can occur in individuals of any racial or ethnic background. Because the causes of megaloblastic anemia vary and because some individuals may not exhibit any obvious symptoms (asymptomatic), determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. A diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of blood tests. Blood tests may reveal the abnormally large, misshapen red blood cells that characterize megaloblastic anemia. Blood tests can also confirm cobalamin or folate deficiency as the cause of megaloblastic anemia.

This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect \u03b2-D-glucan is used.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["pneumonia", [242, 250]], ["AIDS", [502, 505]], ["HIV", [605, 607]], ["cancer", [788, 793]], ["pneumonia", [1208, 1216]]], "rare_disease": [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]], ["PJP", [356, 358]], ["PJP", [377, 379]], ["PJP", [484, 486]], ["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [562, 583]], ["PJP", [811, 813]], ["granulomatosis with polyangiitis", [866, 897]], ["polymyositis", [912, 923]], ["dermatomyositis", [928, 942]], ["PJP", [989, 991]], ["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [1011, 1032]], ["PJP", [1175, 1177]], ["PJP", [1238, 1240]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["pneumonia", [13, 21]], ["shortness of breath", [64, 82]], ["difficulty breathing", [91, 110]], ["fevers", [151, 156]], ["night sweats", [159, 170]], ["weight loss", [173, 183]], ["dry cough", [189, 197]], ["Dry cough", [200, 208]], ["pneumonia", [242, 250]], ["sputum) is too thick to become productive", [266, 306]], ["cough", [330, 334]], ["pneumonia", [575, 583]], ["CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3", [632, 667]], ["pneumonia", [1024, 1032]], ["sputum", [1096, 1101]]], "anaphor": [["This disorder", [113, 125]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]], ["pneumonia", [13, 21]]], [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]], ["shortness of breath", [64, 82]]], [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]], ["difficulty breathing", [91, 110]]], [["This disorder", [113, 125]], ["fevers", [151, 156]]], [["This disorder", [113, 125]], ["night sweats", [159, 170]]], [["This disorder", [113, 125]], ["weight loss", [173, 183]]], [["This disorder", [113, 125]], ["dry cough", [189, 197]]], [["PJP", [356, 358]], ["Dry cough", [200, 208]]], [["PJP", [356, 358]], ["pneumonia", [242, 250]]], [["PJP", [356, 358]], ["sputum) is too thick to become productive", [266, 306]]], [["PJP", [356, 358]], ["cough", [330, 334]]], [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [562, 583]], ["pneumonia", [575, 583]]], [["HIV", [605, 607]], ["CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3", [632, 667]]], [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [1011, 1032]], ["pneumonia", [1024, 1032]]], [["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [1011, 1032]], ["sputum", [1096, 1101]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["AIDS", [502, 505]], ["PJP", [484, 486]]], [["HIV", [605, 607]], ["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [562, 583]]], [["cancer", [788, 793]], ["PJP", [811, 813]]], [["granulomatosis with polyangiitis", [866, 897]], ["PJP", [989, 991]]], [["polymyositis", [912, 923]], ["PJP", [989, 991]]], [["pneumonia", [575, 583]], ["PJP", [1175, 1177]]]], "is_a": [[["PJP", [1175, 1177]], ["pneumonia", [1208, 1216]]]], "is_acron": [[["PJP", [356, 358]], ["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Pneumocystis pneumonia", [0, 21]], ["This disorder", [113, 125]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["cancer", "A tumor composed of atypical neoplastic, often pleomorphic cells that invade other tissues.

It is caused by a toxin that is produced and secreted by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome may include a sudden high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension), and a characteristic skin rash that resemble a bad sunburn. Most cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome occur in menstruating females in association with the use of tampons. Other cases may occur in association with postoperative wound infections, nasal packing, or other factors. The diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control clinical and laboratory criteria.

{"id": "Rubella", "text": "Rubella is a viral infection characterized by fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, aching joints, and a distinctive red rash. Although it is sometimes called German measles or three-day measles, it is not caused by the same virus that causes measles. Rubella is generally mild in children and more severe but not life-threatening in adults. However, if a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, it can cause serious problems for the unborn child. In the United States, most children receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and therefore the disease has become uncommon. In March 2005, health officials announced that rubella has been eliminated from the United States. However, it is still important for Americans to vaccinate their children, and women who are pregnant or might get pregnant still need to be sure they are immune, because the disease exists elsewhere. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nine rubella cases were reported in the United States in 2004, and all of them originated in other countries. Rubella affects males and females in equal numbers.  During 1964 and 1965, according to the CDC, a rubella epidemic in the United States caused an estimated 12.5 million cases of rubella and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome, which led to more than 11,600 babies born deaf, 11,250 fetal deaths, 2,100 neonatal deaths, 3,580 babies born blind, and 1,800 babies born mentally retarded.  Since 1969, the rubella virus has been included in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine routinely given to babies and young children. Since the rubella rash is so much like rashes caused by other viruses, the definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of blood tests for the presence of the virus.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["viral infection", [13, 27]], ["measles", [243, 249]], ["measles", [497, 503]], ["mumps", [505, 509]], ["measles", [1507, 1513]], ["mumps", [1516, 1520]]], "rare_disease": [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["German measles", [159, 172]], ["three-day measles", [177, 193]], ["Rubella", [252, 258]], ["rubella", [388, 394]], ["rubella", [511, 517]], ["rubella", [628, 634]], ["rubella", [952, 958]], ["Rubella", [1057, 1063]], ["rubella", [1156, 1162]], ["rubella", [1236, 1242]], ["congenital rubella syndrome", [1264, 1290]], ["rubella", [1468, 1474]], ["rubella", [1527, 1533]], ["rubella", [1605, 1611]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["fever", [46, 50]], ["headache", [53, 60]], ["swollen lymph nodes", [63, 81]], ["aching joints", [84, 96]], ["distinctive red rash", [105, 124]], ["rash", [1613, 1616]]], "anaphor": [["it", [136, 137]], ["it", [196, 197]], ["it", [397, 398]], ["the disease", [548, 558]], ["the disease", [850, 860]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["fever", [46, 50]]], [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["headache", [53, 60]]], [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["swollen lymph nodes", [63, 81]]], [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["aching joints", [84, 96]]], [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["distinctive red rash", [105, 124]]], [["rubella", [1605, 1611]], ["rash", [1613, 1616]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["viral infection", [13, 27]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [[["German measles", [159, 172]], ["it", [136, 137]]], [["three-day measles", [177, 193]], ["it", [136, 137]]]], "anaphora": [[["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["it", [136, 137]]], [["Rubella", [0, 6]], ["it", [196, 197]]], [["three-day measles", [177, 193]], ["mumps", [505, 509]]], [["rubella", [511, 517]], ["the disease", [548, 558]]], [["rubella", [628, 634]], ["the disease", [850, 860]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["mumps", "A contagious viral infection caused by the mumps virus.

{"id": "Tietze-Syndrome", "text": "The exact cause is not known (idiopathic). Some researchers have speculated that multiple microtrauma to the anterior chest wall may cause the development of Tietze syndrome. Sometimes, the development of the disorder may be preceded by chronic, excessive coughing, vomiting, trauma or impact to the chest, viral or bacterial infections, or surgery to the thoracic area. Tietze syndrome usually affects older children and young adults. Most cases occur before the age of 40, most often during the second or third decade of life. Although rare, Tietze syndrome has been reported in infants, children or the elderly. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown.

{"id": "Ataxia-Telangiectasia", "text": "Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a complex genetic neurodegenerative disorder that may become apparent during infancy or early childhood. The disorder is characterized by progressively impaired coordination of voluntary movements (ataxia), the development of reddish lesions of the skin and mucous membranes due to permanent widening of groups of blood vessels (telangiectasia), and impaired functioning of the immune system (i.e., cellular and humoral immunodeficiency), resulting in increased susceptibility to upper and lower respiratory infections (sinopulmonary infections).

Other symptoms may include susceptibility to easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding from the gums (gingival), intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or variably large red or purple colored spots on the skin that are caused by bleeding in the skin (purpura). Women with GT often also have unusually heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, and excess bleeding in childbirth. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. The severity of the symptoms varies greatly. Some affected individuals have mild bruising and others have severe hemorrhages that can be life threatening.

{"id": "Olivopontocerebellar-Atrophy", "text": "The term olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) has historically been used to describe a group of disorders that affect the central nervous system and are termed neurodegenerative diseases because they result in a progressive deterioration of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. These conditions are characterized by progressive balance problems (disequilibrium), progressive impairment of the ability to coordinate voluntary movements (cerebellar ataxia), and difficulty speaking or slurred speech (dysarthria). OPCA is a group of rare disorders that affects males and females in equal numbers. Because of confusion regarding the naming and classification of these disorders, determining their frequency in the general population is difficult. The frequency of all forms of OPCA has been estimated to be 3-5/100,000 in the United States. A diagnosis of OPCA is a preliminary diagnosis that is made by a thorough clinical examination and identification of characteristic symptoms. Hereditary OPCA can be diagnosed based on a family history of the same condition or by molecular genetic testing for gene mutations known to be associated with the condition. Molecular genetic testing is available for several of the SCAs. A diagnosis of sporadic OPCA is made if hereditary OPCAs and other conditions associated with symptoms of OPCA are ruled out.

{"id": "Multiple-Myeloma", "text": "Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell, are produced in the bone marrow and normally reside there. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body, especially the bone marrow. If only a single tumor is present, the term solitary plasmacytoma is used. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells, the term multiple myeloma is used. Plasma cells are a key component of the immune system and secrete a substance known as immunoglobulin proteins (M-proteins), a type of antibody. Antibodies are special proteins that the body produces to combat invading microorganisms, toxins, or other foreign substances. Overproduction of plasma cells in affected individuals results in abnormally high levels of these proteins within the body, referred to as M proteins. Major symptoms of multiple myeloma may include bone pain, especially in the back and the ribs; low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia) resulting in weakness, fatigue, and lack of color (pallor); and kidney (renal) abnormalities. Some affected individuals are more susceptible to bacterial infections such as pneumonia.

It accounts for 10 percent of all cases of encephalitis in the United States per year. A diagnosis of idiopathic herpes simplex encephalitis is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. These tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may confirm infection of CSF with the herpes simplex virus.

{"id": "Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal-Syndrome", "text": "Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is a genetic degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord that begins before birth. The disorder is characterized by growth failure at birth and little or no neurological development, structural abnormalities of the eye and fixed bending of the spine and joints.  Abnormalities of the skull, face, limbs and other parts of the body may also occur. COFS syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. COFS is now considered to be part of the spectrum of disorders within Cockayne syndrome. Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome is a very rare disorder present at birth.  It affects males and females and occurs in many ethnic groups. The diagnosis of COFS syndrome is often made based on physical features seen at birth.

{"id": "Giant-Cell-Myocarditis", "text": "Giant cell myocarditis is a rare cardiovascular disorder that occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). It is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium), a condition referred to as myocarditis. Inflammation is caused by widespread infiltration of giant cells associated with other inflammatory cells and heart muscle cell destruction. Giant cells are abnormal masses produced by the fusion of inflammatory cells called macrophages. Individuals with giant cell myocarditis may develop abnormal heartbeats, chest pain and, eventually, heart failure. Many individuals eventually require a heart transplant. The disorder most often occurs in young adults. Giant cell myocarditis affects males and females in equal numbers. It can affect individuals of any age although the majority of cases occur in young or middle-aged adults (median age 42 years). Approximately 300 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis is made by biopsy of heart tissue. A biopsy is a test in which small tissue sample is surgically removed and studied microscopically. Tests to exclude other cause of heart abnormalities may also be performed. These tests may include echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["cardiovascular disorder", [33, 55]]], "rare_disease": [["Giant cell myocarditis", [0, 21]], ["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["Giant cell myocarditis", [671, 692]], ["giant cell myocarditis", [951, 972]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["myocarditis", [11, 21]], ["myocarditis", [200, 210]], ["Inflammation", [213, 224]], ["widespread infiltration of giant cells", [239, 276]], ["heart muscle cell destruction", [323, 351]], ["myocarditis", [479, 489]], ["abnormal heartbeats", [503, 521]], ["chest pain", [524, 533]], ["heart failure", [552, 564]], ["myocarditis", [682, 692]], ["myocarditis", [962, 972]], ["heart abnormalities", [1140, 1158]]], "anaphor": [["It", [103, 104]], ["The disorder", [623, 634]], ["It", [738, 739]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["myocarditis", [479, 489]], ["Giant cell myocarditis", [0, 21]]], [["It", [103, 104]], ["myocarditis", [200, 210]]], [["It", [103, 104]], ["Inflammation", [213, 224]]], [["It", [103, 104]], ["widespread infiltration of giant cells", [239, 276]]], [["It", [103, 104]], ["heart muscle cell destruction", [323, 351]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["myocarditis", [479, 489]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["abnormal heartbeats", [503, 521]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["chest pain", [524, 533]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["heart failure", [552, 564]]], [["Giant cell myocarditis", [671, 692]], ["myocarditis", [682, 692]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [951, 972]], ["myocarditis", [962, 972]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [951, 972]], ["heart abnormalities", [1140, 1158]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["myocarditis", [479, 489]], ["abnormal heartbeats", [503, 521]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["myocarditis", [479, 489]], ["myocarditis", [962, 972]]], [["giant cell myocarditis", [468, 489]], ["The disorder", [623, 634]]], [["Giant cell myocarditis", [671, 692]], ["It", [738, 739]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["condition", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["myocarditis", "Myocarditis is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium).

The disorder is immune-mediated, which means there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system and the presence of specific autoantibodies that target a specific protein in the body. The symptoms and severity of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. Common symptoms include inflammation of the muscles (myositis), inflammation of several joints (polyarthritis), interstitial lung disease, thickening and cracking of the skin of the hands, and a condition called Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers or toes are numb or have a prickly sensation in response to cold. Affected individuals also have nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, unexplained fevers, and unintended weight loss. The exact, underlying cause is not fully understood. Antisynthetase syndrome sometimes occurs along with other conditions such as uncommon inflammatory muscle diseases like dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Antisynthetase syndrome is a rare disorder that affects females twice as often as males. Age of onset can range from the late teens to the elderly, with a mean average of the 50s.

The diagnosis of bejel is based on the geographic history of the patient as well as laboratory testing of material from the lesions (darkfield examination). The responsible bacterium is readily identifiable on sight in a microscope as a treponema.

{"id": "Epidermal-Nevus-Syndromes", "text": "Epidermal nevus syndromes (ENSs) are a group of rare complex disorders characterized by the presence of skin lesions known as epidermal nevi associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities, most often affecting the brain, eye and skeletal systems. Epidermal nevi are overgrowths of structures and tissue of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. The different types of epidermal nevi can vary in size, number, location, distribution and appearance. Neurological abnormalities that can be associated with ENSs can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). Skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs). Ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, clouding (opacity) of the cornea or partial absence of tissue of the iris or retina (colobomas). Endocrine abnormalities such as vitamin D-resistant rickets have been associated with Schimmelpenning syndrome. The specific symptoms and severity of ENSs can vary greatly from one person to another. Most ENSs occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). Epidermal nevi (including as an isolated finding) have been reported to occur in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births. The percentage of individuals with epidermal nevi who also have extra-cutaneous malformations is much lower but likewise unknown. The prevalence and incidence of individual ENSs is unknown. A diagnosis of an epidermal nevus syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history and a thorough clinical evaluation. In some cases, a small sample of affected skin may be taken for microscopic study (biopsy). Additional tests may be required to detect the presence and extent of associated symptoms. Such tests include a skeletal survey, chest x-rays and specialized imaging techniques to evaluate the brain. Such imaging techniques may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whether a child with an epidermal nevus should undergo such imaging techniques is controversial. Some researchers believe that these tests should be avoided unless there are clinical signs of central nervous involvement. In three of the well-defined ENSs (type 2 segmental Cowden disease, Garc\u00eda-Hafner-Happle syndrome, CHILD syndrome), molecular testing is now possible.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["vitamin D-resistant rickets", [1009, 1035]]], "rare_disease": [["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]], ["ENSs", [27, 30]], ["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["Schimmelpenning syndrome", [1063, 1086]], ["ENSs", [1127, 1130]], ["ENSs", [1182, 1185]], ["ENSs", [1700, 1703]], ["epidermal nevus syndrome", [1735, 1758]], ["epidermal nevus", [2313, 2327]], ["ENSs", [2539, 2542]], ["type 2 segmental Cowden disease", [2545, 2575]], ["Garc\u00eda-Hafner-Happle syndrome", [2578, 2606]], ["CHILD syndrome", [2609, 2622]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["skin lesions", [104, 115]], ["epidermal nevi associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities", [126, 196]], ["Epidermal nevi", [257, 270]], ["epidermal nevi", [387, 400]], ["Neurological abnormalities", [467, 492]], ["seizures", [539, 546]], ["cognitive impairment", [549, 568]], ["developmental delays", [571, 590]], ["hemiparesis", [631, 641]], ["Skeletal abnormalities", [645, 666]], ["abnormal curvature of the spine", [680, 710]], ["malformation of the hip", [713, 735]], ["abnormalities of the arms and legs", [741, 774]], ["underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs", [783, 832]], ["Ocular abnormalities", [836, 855]], ["cataracts", [869, 877]], ["clouding (opacity) of the cornea", [880, 911]], ["colobomas", [965, 973]], ["Endocrine abnormalities", [977, 999]], ["Epidermal nevi", [1402, 1415]], ["epidermal nev", [1562, 1574]], ["extra-cutaneous malformations", [1591, 1619]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]], ["skin lesions", [104, 115]]], [["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]], ["epidermal nevi associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities", [126, 196]]], [["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]], ["Epidermal nevi", [257, 270]]], [["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]], ["epidermal nevi", [387, 400]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["Neurological abnormalities", [467, 492]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["seizures", [539, 546]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["cognitive impairment", [549, 568]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["developmental delays", [571, 590]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["hemiparesis", [631, 641]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["Skeletal abnormalities", [645, 666]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["abnormal curvature of the spine", [680, 710]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["malformation of the hip", [713, 735]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["abnormalities of the arms and legs", [741, 774]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs", [783, 832]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["Ocular abnormalities", [836, 855]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["cataracts", [869, 877]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["clouding (opacity) of the cornea", [880, 911]]], [["ENSs", [522, 525]], ["colobomas", [965, 973]]], [["vitamin D-resistant rickets", [1009, 1035]], ["Endocrine abnormalities", [977, 999]]], [["ENSs", [1182, 1185]], ["Epidermal nevi", [1402, 1415]]], [["ENSs", [1182, 1185]], ["epidermal nev", [1562, 1574]]], [["ENSs", [1182, 1185]], ["extra-cutaneous malformations", [1591, 1619]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["type 2 segmental Cowden disease", [2545, 2575]], ["ENSs", [2539, 2542]]], [["Garc\u00eda-Hafner-Happle syndrome", [2578, 2606]], ["ENSs", [2539, 2542]]]], "is_acron": [[["ENSs", [27, 30]], ["Epidermal nevus syndromes", [0, 24]]]], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorders", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["syndrome", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["syndromes", "A group of signs, symptoms, and clinicopathological characteristics that may or may not have a genetic basis and collectively define an abnormal condition."], ["skin", "A benign or malignant tumor involving the skin.

{"id": "Leri-Pleonosteosis", "text": "\"Leri Pleonosteosis is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by unusual, flattened facial features, abnormalities of the hands and feet, skeletal malformations, short stature, and/or limitation of joint movements. Characteristic abnormalities of the hands and feet may include unusually broad and/or short thumbs and great toes (brachydactyly) that may be bent outward from the body (valgus position); as a result, the hands may have a \"\"spade-shaped\"\" appearance. Skeletal malformations may include knees that are bent backward (genu recurvitum) and abnormal enlargement of the cartilaginous structures that surround the upper portion of the spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae). In addition, affected individuals may develop thickened tissue on the palms (palmar) and forearms. Symptoms may vary from case to case. Leri pleonosteosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Leri pleonosteosis is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Approximately 20 cases have been reported worldwide, with most of these outside of North America. The symptoms and physical characteristics associated with Leri pleonosteosis usually become apparent during infancy or early childhood. The diagnosis of Leri pleonosteosis may be established by a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, detailed patient history, and/or specialized tests including advanced imaging techniques (e.g., various x-ray methods). For example, enlargement of the cartilage that surrounds the upper spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae), is an important characteristic of this disorder and is potentially detectable by x-ray studies.\"", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["inherited disorder", [41, 58]], ["inherited disorder", [969, 986]]], "rare_disease": [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["Leri pleonosteosis", [857, 874]], ["Leri pleonosteosis", [929, 946]], ["Leri pleonosteosis", [1194, 1211]], ["Leri pleonosteosis", [1289, 1306]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["flattened facial features", [86, 110]], ["abnormalities of the hands", [113, 138]], ["abnormalities of the hands and feet", [113, 147]], ["skeletal malformations", [150, 171]], ["short stature", [174, 186]], ["limitation of joint movements", [196, 224]], ["abnormalities of the hands", [242, 267]], ["abnormalities of the hands and feet", [242, 276]], ["brachydactyly", [342, 354]], ["hands may have a \"\"spade-shaped\"\" appearance", [432, 475]], ["Skeletal malformations", [478, 499]], ["genu recurvitum", [543, 557]], ["enlargement of the cartilaginous structures that surround the upper portion of the spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae)", [573, 718]], ["thickened tissue on the palms", [767, 795]], ["thickened tissue on the palms (palmar) and forearms", [767, 817]], ["enlargement of the cartilage that surrounds the upper spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae)", [1529, 1645]]], "anaphor": [["this disorder", [1682, 1694]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["abnormalities of the hands", [113, 138]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["abnormalities of the hands and feet", [113, 147]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["skeletal malformations", [150, 171]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["short stature", [174, 186]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["limitation of joint movements", [196, 224]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["abnormalities of the hands", [242, 267]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["abnormalities of the hands and feet", [242, 276]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["brachydactyly", [342, 354]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["hands may have a \"\"spade-shaped\"\" appearance", [432, 475]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["Skeletal malformations", [478, 499]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["genu recurvitum", [543, 557]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["enlargement of the cartilaginous structures that surround the upper portion of the spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae)", [573, 718]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["thickened tissue on the palms", [767, 795]]], [["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["thickened tissue on the palms (palmar) and forearms", [767, 817]]], [["this disorder", [1682, 1694]], ["enlargement of the cartilage that surrounds the upper spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae)", [1529, 1645]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [[["Leri Pleonosteosis", [1, 18]], ["inherited disorder", [41, 58]]], [["Leri pleonosteosis", [929, 946]], ["inherited disorder", [969, 986]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Leri pleonosteosis", [1289, 1306]], ["this disorder", [1682, 1694]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["as", "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening.

{"id": "Multiple-Sulfatase-Deficiency", "text": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency is a very rare hereditary metabolic disorder in which all of the known sulfatase enzymes (thought to be seven in number) are deficient or inoperative. Major symptoms include mildly coarsened facial features, deafness, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Abnormalities of the skeleton may occur, such as curvature of the spine (lumbar kyphosis) and the breast bone. The skin is usually dry and scaly (ichthyosis). Before symptoms are noticeable, children with this disorder usually develop more slowly than normal. They may not learn to walk or speak as quickly as other children. Multiple sulfatase deficiency is present at birth, although symptoms of this disorder don\u2019t become noticeable until the first or second year of life.  It is a very rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers. Treatment for the symptoms of skeletal abnormalities in multiple sulfatase deficiency is symptomatic and supportive. An orthopedist can provide treatment for curvature of the spine. Dermatologic symptoms (ichthyosis) are treated by applying skin softening (emollient) ointments, preferably plain petroleum jelly.

{"id": "Glutaric-Aciduria-Type-I", "text": "Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). It is in the group of disorders known as cerebral organic acidemias. Individuals with this condition have deficiency or absence of GCDH enzyme that is involved in the lysine metabolism. GCDH deficiency results in increased concentrations of potentially neurotoxic metabolites, glutaric acid (GA), 3-hydroxy glutaric acid (3-OH-GA) and glutaconic acid within body tissues, especially within the brain. Two arbitrary biochemical subtypes have been defined, high (HE) and low excretors (LE), depending on the amount of GA in the urine. Newborns may show unspecific clinical signs like enlarged head circumference (macrocephaly) or decreased muscle tone (hypotonia).  Without treatment, most affected children develop an acute encephalopathic crisis following febrile illness episodes or other catabolic conditions resulting in bilateral striatal injury and consequently, dystonic movement disorder. Cognitive outcome has not been systematically studied, but severe cognitive dysfunction is rarely seen. Sometimes babies with GA1 have been mistaken to have been abused because they present with subdural and/or retinal hemorrhages. GA1 is included in the newborn screening panel in a growing number of countries which is essential for early intervention.  Importantly, patients with the low excreting phenotype may be missed by newborn screening. GA1 is a rare inborn error of metabolism that affects males as often as females.

{"id": "Gianotti-Crosti-Syndrome", "text": "Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is a rare skin disease affecting children between the ages of nine months and nine years. Major symptoms may include blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks and arms. The disorder is usually preceded by a viral infection. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is characterized by blisters on the skin that may or may not itch.  They are usually found on the face, buttocks, arms or legs. The blisters consist of large, flat-topped, fluid filled sacks.  They usually occur along with upper respiratory tract infection.  The blisters usually last from twenty to twenty-five days; they do not usually recur.  There may be an enlargement of the lymph nodes in the trunk area of the body. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome usually occurs after a bout with a viral disease such as:  Coxsackievirus, Hepatitis-B, Infectious Mononucleosis or Cytomegalovirus, or after vaccination with a live virus serum. The cause of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is thought to be a reaction to a previous viral infection.  In many countries the predisposing cause is usually the Hepatitis-B virus.  In North America other viruses are more often the predisposing cause.  The exact reasons for this cause and effect situation are unknown. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome usually affects children between the ages of nine months and nine years of age.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. Although the disorder is regularly associated with Hepatitis-B infections in other countries, in North America it is rarely the cause. Because Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is a self-limiting disorder, the treatment of affected children is primarily symptomatic and supportive. For example, in some cases, the use of topical ointments or certain medications by mouth may be recommended to help alleviate mild to potentially severe itching (pruritus). The skin lesions associated with Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome typically spontaneously resolve within approximately 15 to 60 days. When associated findings include enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) and/or enlargement of the liver (i.e., in association with liver inflammation [hepatitis]), such findings may persist for several months after initial symptom onset.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["skin disease", [35, 46]], ["viral infection", [233, 247]], ["viral disease", [759, 771]], ["Coxsackievirus", [783, 796]], ["Hepatitis-B", [799, 809]], ["Infectious Mononucleosis", [812, 835]], ["Cytomegalovirus", [840, 854]], ["viral infection", [983, 997]], ["Hepatitis-B virus", [1057, 1073]], ["Hepatitis-B", [1419, 1429]], ["hepatitis", [2101, 2109]]], "rare_disease": [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [916, 939]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1215, 1238]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1511, 1534]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1847, 1870]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["blisters on the skin of the legs", [142, 173]], ["blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks", [142, 183]], ["blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks and arms", [142, 192]], ["blisters on the skin", [295, 314]], ["blisters", [407, 414]], ["upper respiratory tract infection", [498, 530]], ["blisters", [538, 545]], ["enlargement of the lymph nodes in the trunk area", [637, 684]], ["pruritus", [1803, 1810]], ["skin lesions", [1818, 1829]], ["lymphadenopathy", [2005, 2019]], ["enlargement of the liver", [2029, 2052]], ["hepatitis", [2101, 2109]]], "anaphor": [["The disorder", [195, 206]], ["It", [1321, 1322]], ["the disorder", [1377, 1388]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["blisters on the skin of the legs", [142, 173]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks", [142, 183]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks and arms", [142, 192]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["blisters on the skin", [295, 314]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["blisters", [407, 414]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["upper respiratory tract infection", [498, 530]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["blisters", [538, 545]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [250, 273]], ["enlargement of the lymph nodes in the trunk area", [637, 684]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1511, 1534]], ["pruritus", [1803, 1810]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1847, 1870]], ["skin lesions", [1818, 1829]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1847, 1870]], ["lymphadenopathy", [2005, 2019]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1847, 1870]], ["enlargement of the liver", [2029, 2052]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1847, 1870]], ["hepatitis", [2101, 2109]]]], "increases_risk_of": [[["viral infection", [233, 247]], ["The disorder", [195, 206]]], [["viral disease", [759, 771]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]]], [["Coxsackievirus", [783, 796]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]]], [["Hepatitis-B", [799, 809]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]]], [["Infectious Mononucleosis", [812, 835]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]]], [["Cytomegalovirus", [840, 854]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [699, 722]]], [["viral infection", [983, 997]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [916, 939]]], [["Hepatitis-B virus", [1057, 1073]], ["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [916, 939]]], [["Hepatitis-B", [1419, 1429]], ["the disorder", [1377, 1388]]]], "is_a": [[["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["skin disease", [35, 46]]]], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [0, 23]], ["The disorder", [195, 206]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1215, 1238]], ["It", [1321, 1322]]], [["Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome", [1215, 1238]], ["the disorder", [1377, 1388]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["Hepatitis", "An active inflammatory process affecting the liver for more than six months.

Each chromosome has a short arm designated as \"p,\" a long arm identified by the letter \"q,\" and a narrowed region at which the two arms are joined (centromere). Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered outward from the centromere. For example, the short arm of chromosome 9 includes bands 9p11 to 9p24, and the long arm includes bands 9q11 to 9q34.

{"id": "Pyruvate-Dehydrogenase-Complex-Deficiency", "text": "Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [["mental retardation", [690, 707]]], "rare_disease": [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["PDCD", [493, 496]], ["PDCD", [739, 742]], ["PDCD", [770, 773]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant", [41, 107]], ["lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant", [55, 107]], ["tachypnea) in an infant", [85, 107]], ["motor delay", [237, 247]], ["poor muscle tone", [250, 265]], ["seizures", [268, 275]], ["ataxia", [294, 299]], ["abnormal eye movements", [303, 324]], ["poor visual tracking", [330, 349]], ["ataxia", [566, 571]], ["upper respiratory infection", [596, 622]], ["minor stress", [633, 644]], ["neurologic deficits", [666, 684]], ["mental retardation", [690, 707]], ["Biochemical abnormalities", [973, 997]], ["severe acidosis", [1013, 1027]], ["alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes", [1338, 1385]]], "anaphor": []}, "relations": {"produces": [[["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant", [41, 107]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant", [55, 107]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["tachypnea) in an infant", [85, 107]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["motor delay", [237, 247]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["poor muscle tone", [250, 265]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["seizures", [268, 275]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["ataxia", [294, 299]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["abnormal eye movements", [303, 324]]], [["PDCD", [19, 22]], ["poor visual tracking", [330, 349]]], [["PDCD", [493, 496]], ["ataxia", [566, 571]]], [["PDCD", [493, 496]], ["upper respiratory infection", [596, 622]]], [["PDCD", [493, 496]], ["minor stress", [633, 644]]], [["PDCD", [739, 742]], ["neurologic deficits", [666, 684]]], [["PDCD", [739, 742]], ["mental retardation", [690, 707]]], [["PDCD", [770, 773]], ["Biochemical abnormalities", [973, 997]]], [["PDCD", [770, 773]], ["severe acidosis", [1013, 1027]]], [["PDCD", [770, 773]], ["alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes", [1338, 1385]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": []}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["ataxia", "A central nervous system disease that consists of gait impairment, unclear (\u201cscanning\u201d) speech, visual blurring due to nystagmus, hand incoordination, and tremor with movement."], ["mental retardation", "A broad category of disorders characterized by an impairment to the intelligence an individual possesses.

{"id": "Whipple-Disease", "text": "Whipple disease is a rare disease resulting from bacterial infection that leads to inadequate absorption of nutrients (malabsorption) from the intestine. It is believed to result from infection with bacteria known as Tropheryma whippelii. The infection usually involves the small intestine, but over time, the disease may affect various parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and eyes. Whipple disease is caused by a rod-shaped bacterium called Tropheryma whippelii.  This bacterium was first identified in 1991/92.  Its natural habitats are unknown, but it appears likely that infection occurs by way of an environmental source and that the bacteria are introduced into the body through the mouth (peroral). Whipple disease affects more males than females in a ratio of approximately 4 to 1.  The symptoms of this disorder typically begin between the ages of thirty and sixty years.  The age range of those affected is thought to be between 30 and 80, with the median age at time of diagnosis being 56 years.  Most of the cases of Whipple disease have been diagnosed among Europeans and  Americans of European parentage.  In Germany, the disease incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million population per year.  A few cases have been reported among American Indians and Americans of African descent. In 2004, for the first time, a case of Whipple disease was reported in Japan. The standard diagnostic approach is to study a tissue sample (biopsy) from the small intestine. Blood testing can determine whether anemia is present. Confirmation of diagnosis can be achieved either by electron microscopy or by a test known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which detects the DNA of T. whippelii.", "gold": {"entities": {"disease": [], "rare_disease": [["Whipple disease", [0, 14]], ["Whipple disease", [401, 415]], ["Whipple disease", [724, 738]], ["Whipple disease", [1047, 1061]], ["Whipple disease", [1359, 1373]]], "symptom_and_sign": [["malabsorption", [119, 131]], ["anemia", [1530, 1535]]], "anaphor": [["It", [154, 155]], ["the disease", [306, 316]], ["this disorder", [825, 837]], ["the disease", [1150, 1160]]]}, "relations": {"produces": [[["Whipple disease", [0, 14]], ["malabsorption", [119, 131]]], [["Whipple disease", [1359, 1373]], ["anemia", [1530, 1535]]]], "increases_risk_of": [], "is_a": [], "is_acron": [], "is_synon": [], "anaphora": [[["Whipple disease", [0, 14]], ["It", [154, 155]]], [["Whipple disease", [0, 14]], ["the disease", [306, 316]]], [["Whipple disease", [724, 738]], ["this disorder", [825, 837]]], [["Whipple disease", [1047, 1061]], ["the disease", [1150, 1160]]]]}}, "cache": {"step1": {"medical_terms": [["disease", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["disorder", "A disease is a disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism."], ["anemia", "A reduction in the number of red blood cells, the amount of hemoglobin, and/or the volume of packed red blood cells.

This condition is characterized by a specific finding on an MRI called a \"\"molar tooth sign\"\" in which the cerebellar vermis of the brain is absent or underdeveloped and the brain stem is abnormal. The most common features of Joubert syndrome are lack of muscle control (ataxia), abnormal breathing patterns (hyperpnea), sleep apnea, abnormal eye and tongue movements and low muscle tone. The prevalence of Joubert syndrome has been estimated to be 1/258,000 but is probably an underestimate of the true prevalence, which may be closer to 1/100,000.

Molecular genetic testing is available for the four genes that have been shown to cause Joubert syndrome in about 40% of cases.

{"id": "Transverse-Myelitis", "text": "TM has a conservatively estimated incidence of between 1 and 8 new cases per million per year, or approximately 1400 new cases each year. Although this disease affects people of all ages, with a range of six months to 88 years, there are bimodal peaks between the ages of 10 to 19 years and 30 to 39 years. In addition, approximately 25% of cases are in children. There is no gender or familial association with TM. In 75-90% of cases TM is monophasic, yet a small percentage experience recurrent disease especially if there is a predisposing underlying illness. As mentioned above, TM may be a relatively uncommon manifestation of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and sarcoidosis. SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause that affects multiple organs and tissues in the body. SLE may cause TM that may even be recurrent. Sjogren\u2019s disease is another autoimmune disease characterized by invasion and infiltration of the tear and salivary glands by white blood cells with resultant decreased production of these fluids leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. Several tests can support this diagnosis: the presence of a SS-A/SS-B antibody in the blood, ophthalmologic tests that confirm decreased tear production and the demonstration of lymphocytic infiltration in biopsy specimens of the small salivary glands (a minimally invasive procedure). Neurologic manifestations are unusual in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, but spinal cord inflammation can occur. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown cause and manifested by enlarged lymph nodes, lung inflammation, various skin lesions, liver and other organ involvement. In the nervous system, various nerves, as well as the spinal cord, may be involved. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by biopsy, demonstrating features of inflammation typical of sarcoidosis.

{"id": "Typhoid", "text": "Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that is rare in the United States. However, it is not rare in many other countries. Major symptoms may include unusually high fever, headache, loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Typhoid is caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.  It is the most serious of the Salmonella infections.  Contaminated food or water is most often the source of a Typhoid outbreak.  Contact with a carrier of the bacterium, polluted water, infected food or milk, shellfish harvested from polluted water, or fresh vegetables grown in contaminated soil are all sources of the Salmonella Typhi bacterium.  People who have had Typhoid are \u201ccarriers\u201d until the bacteria is completely gone from their body.  If they touch food served to other people when their hands are not properly washed, they can spread Typhoid to those who eat the food. Typhoid is treated with the antibiotic drugs chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefoperazone, pefloxacin, co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Precautions to take, especially when visiting countries with unsanitary conditions, includes the practice of good personal hygiene and careful washing of hands. Avoid drinking untreated water, drinks served with ice, unpeeled fruits and vegetables, and other food that is cooked and not served hot. In food preparation; wash and sanitize utensils in hot water; carefully clean cutting boards, work areas and equipment; keep hot foods at 165 F and cold foods at 40 F or colder to avoid the possible growth of bacteria in food.

However, associated features often include severe intellectual disability; growth delays after birth (postnatal growth retardation); distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; a short neck; and/or structural defects of the heart that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). Several cases have also been reported in which affected individuals have some features of DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). DGS is a congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands, potentially causing abnormalities of the immune system, deficient production of parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism), a heart defect, and associated findings. In many cases, chromosome 10, monosomy 10p appears to occur spontaneously (de novo) for unknown reasons. Chromosome 10, monosomy 10p is typically evident at birth (congenital).

However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.

{"id": "Liposarcoma", "text": "The specific cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 \u2013 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma.

{"id": "Opsoclonus", "text": "The component features of OMS include repeated, random and rapid eye movements in both horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (opsoclonus); unsteady gait or loss of ability to stand and walk (ataxia); brief, repeated, shock-like spasms of several muscles within the arms, legs (myoclonus), or tremor interfering with hand use. Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated \u2018idiopathic\u2019 or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 \u2013 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the \u2018dancing eyes\u2019, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called \u201cMS panel\u201d, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.", "gold":

{"id": "Mumps", "text": "Mumps is an acute viral illness that causes a painful inflammation and swelling of the saliva glands. These glands include the parotid, submaxillary, sublingual and buccal salivary glands. Mumps used to be a common infectious disease of childhood until a vaccine was developed in 1967 to immunize children against the virus that causes the disorder. However, recent outbreaks of mumps among adolescents and young adults have raised questions about lifetime immunity from the vaccine. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that is transmitted through saliva by direct contact, or in the form of airborne droplets from the nose, throat or mouth.  The virus enters the body through the upper respiratory tract. Since 1967 when an effective and safe vaccine was developed, mumps has become uncommon.

{"id": "Neuromyelitis-Optica-Spectrum-Disorder", "text": "NMOSD occurs in individuals of all races. The prevalence of NMOSD is approximately 1-10 per 100,000 individuals and seems to be similar worldwide, although somewhat higher rates have been reported in countries with a higher proportion of individuals of African ancestry. Relative to MS that it mimics, it occurs with greater frequency in individuals of Asian and African descent, but the majority of patients with this illness in Western countries are Caucasian. Individuals of any age may be affected, but typically NMOSD, especially cases seropositive for AQP4-IgG, occur in late middle-aged women. Equal numbers of men and women have the form that does not recur after the initial flurry of attacks, but women, especially those with AQP4-IgG, are four or five times more likely to be affected than men by the recurring (relapsing) form. Children represent may also be affected by this condition; children more commonly develop brain symptoms at onset and seem to have a higher frequency of monophasic presentation than adults. A diagnosis of NMOSD is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests include blood tests, examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), spinal taps, or x-ray procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) or computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans. A blood test, AQP4-IgG, is highly specific and moderately sensitive for NMOSD. It has been shown that it detects antibodies that are specific for an astrocyte protein, aquaporin-4. This is very helpful to request this test at the first significant suspicion of NMOSD, as it is frequently positive at the time of the very first symptom even before a confident clinical diagnosis is possible.  A recently discovered antibody, MOG-IgG, is present in about half of those who do not have AQP4-IgG; while it seems specific for a form of NMOSD, and is rarely seen in typical MS, it also occurs in some patients with recurrent optic neuritis and in some patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; in the latter patients, it is often transient.

The specific symptoms and severity of Alagille syndrome can vary greatly from one person to another, even within the same family. Some individuals may have mild forms of the disorder while others may have more serious forms. Common symptoms, which often develop during the first three months of life, include blockage of the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis), yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), poor weight gain and growth, severe itching (pruritis) and pale, loose stools. Additional symptoms include heart murmurs, congenital heart defects, vertebral (back bone) differences, thickening of the ring that normally lines the cornea in the eye (posterior embryotoxon) and distinctive facial features. Most people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in one copy of the JAG1 gene. A small percentage (less than 1 percent) of patients have mutations of the NOTCH2 gene. These mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, however in about half of cases the mutation occurs as a new change (\"de novo\") in the individual and was not inherited from a parent. The current estimated incidence of ALGS is between 1:30,000 and 1:45,000 with no difference in gender. Alagille syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Alagille syndrome has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 30,000-45,000 individuals in the general population.

{"id": "Hypoplastic-Left-Heart-Syndrome", "text": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The valves allow for blood to be pumped through the chambers. Blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). The aorta sends the blood throughout the body. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males (67 percent) more often than females. The estimated prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 100,000 live births. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 7-9 percent of all congenital heart defects. The symptoms of this disorder are present at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests.

{"id": "Congenital-Adrenal-Hyperplasia", "text": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of rare inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of one of the enzymes needed to make specific hormones. CAH effects the adrenal glands located at the top of each kidney. Normally, the adrenal glands are responsible for producing three different hormones: 1. corticosteroids, which gauge the body's response to illness or injury; 2. mineralocorticoids, which regulate salt and water levels; and 3. androgens, which are male sex hormones. An enzyme deficiency will make the body unable to produce one or more of these hormones, which in turn will result in the overproduction of another type of hormone precursor in order to compensate for the loss. The most common form of CAH, 21 hydroxylase deficiency, affects approximately 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the United States and Europe. Among the Yupik Eskimos, the occurrence of the salt-wasting form of this disorder may be as high as 1 in 282 individuals. Other forms of CAH are much rarer.

{"id": "Agenesis-of-Corpus-Callosum", "text": "Agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It is characterized by a partial or complete absence (agenesis) of an area of the brain that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. This part of the brain is normally composed of transverse fibers. The cause of agenesis of corpus callosum is usually not known, but it can be inherited as either an autosomal recessive trait or an X-linked dominant trait. It can also be caused by an infection or injury during the twelfth to the twenty-second week of pregnancy (intrauterine) leading to developmental disturbance of the fetal brain. Intrauterine exposure to alcohol (Fetal alcohol syndrome) can also result in ACC. In some cases mental retardation may result, but intelligence may be only mildly impaired and subtle psychosocial symptoms may be present. Agenesis of Corpus Callosum produces symptoms during the first two years of life in approximately ninety percent of those affected. It has been thought to be a very rare condition but the increased use of neuro-imaging techniques, such as MRI, is resulting in an increased rate of diagnosis.  This condition may also be identified during pregnancy through an ultrasound.  Currently, the highest estimate of incidence is 7 in 1000 individuals. Agenesis of corpus callosum can occur in conjunction with spina bifida. Spina bifida is a term meaning open (or non-fused) spine.  In spina bifida, one or more of the individual bones of the spine fails to close completely, leaving a cleft or defect in the spinal canal. Part of the contents of the spine can protrude or herniate through this abnormal opening that produces a meningocele or meningomyelocele. (For more information on this disorder, choose \u201cspina bifida\u201d as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

{"id": "Wernicke", "text": "Wernicke syndrome and Korsakoff syndrome are related disorders that often occur due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Wernicke's syndrome, also known as Wernicke encephalopathy, is a neurological disease characterized by the clinical triad of confusion, the inability to coordinate voluntary movement (ataxia), and eye (ocular) abnormalities. Korsakoff's syndrome is a mental disorder characterized by disproportionate memory loss in relation to other mental aspects. When these two disorders occur together, the term Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is used. In the United States, most cases occur in alcoholics.
